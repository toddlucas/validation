# Docuscribe - Product Overview
## AI Document Management for Multi-Document Intelligence

**Date:** February 12, 2026  
**Product:** Docuscribe  
**Status:** Concept → Validation Phase

---

## Executive Summary

Docuscribe is an AI-powered document workspace that brings Cursor's agentic capabilities to structured document workflows. The system enables intelligent research, multi-file document creation, and cross-document consistency management for cloud-stored documents (SharePoint, OneDrive, Google Drive).

**Core Innovation:** Multi-document intelligence that maintains coherence, consistency, and citations across entire document projects—a capability current frontier models lack.

**Target Market:** Professional document creators managing complex, multi-document projects with high stakes and tight deadlines.

---

## The Problem

### Current State: Isolated Document Editing

AI tools treat each document independently with no project-level understanding or coordination. Manual effort is required to maintain consistency across related files.

### Why This Matters: Multi-Document Projects Are Everywhere

- **Grant proposals:** Summary, technical approach, budget, bios, evaluation plans
- **RFP responses:** Technical proposal, past performance, pricing, compliance matrix, resumes
- **Legal document sets:** Contracts, exhibits, schedules, amendments, discovery documents
- **Consulting deliverables:** Executive summary, detailed findings, appendices, presentation deck
- **Academic work:** Dissertation chapters, papers, literature reviews
- **Technical documentation:** Architecture docs, API specs, user guides

### The Pain

Users struggle with:
- "I need to update the revenue figure in 5 different documents"
- "These three documents contradict each other"
- "I have 20 research papers and need to write 4 coordinated documents"
- "Our company name changed—I need to update it everywhere"
- "The executive summary is out of sync with the detailed report"

---

## The Solution

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk

1. **Microsoft/Google Build This First**
   - **Mitigation:** Move fast, focus on multi-doc intelligence they don't have
   - **Advantage:** We can be more specialized and better at this use case

2. **Document Format Complexity**
   - **Mitigation:** Start with simpler formats (markdown, Google Docs)
   - **Advantage:** Phased approach reduces risk

### Medium Risk

3. **User Trust in AI Document Edits**
   - **Mitigation:** Excellent preview/diff UX, clear undo, change history
   - **Advantage:** Learn from Cursor's success in building trust

4. **API Rate Limits and Costs**
   - **Mitigation:** Efficient caching, batch operations, user quotas
   - **Advantage:** Users pay for value, not API calls

### Low Risk

5. **Competition from General AI Tools**
   - **Mitigation:** Deep specialization in multi-document workflows
   - **Advantage:** Vertical focus creates moat

---

## Common Objections & Responses

**"I can just use Google Docs/Word"**
- *Response:* "Google Docs stores files. Docuscribe understands relationships between documents. We track citations, detect inconsistencies, and propagate changes across your entire document set automatically."

**"This seems expensive"**
- *Response:* "One [proposal/grant/case] takes 60 hours at $100/hour = $6,000 in labor. We save you 20+ hours per project. You'll save multiples of the subscription cost in the first month."

**"I'm worried about AI accuracy"**
- *Response:* "You're in control. We suggest changes and flag inconsistencies - you approve everything. Think of it as a smart assistant that catches what humans miss, not a replacement for human judgment."

**"What about data security?"**
- *Response:* "Your documents stay in your Google Drive/SharePoint. We connect via secure API. We don't store your documents - only metadata and embeddings for search and consistency checking."

---

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Week 1-2)
1. Build markdown-based proof of concept
2. Implement core tools (read, write, search, consistency check)
3. Create demo: 3-document generation from 5 sources
4. Validate with potential users (grant writers, consultants)

### Short-term (Month 1-2)
5. Add vector store for semantic search
6. Implement change propagation across documents
7. Build citation tracking system
8. Create web-based UI prototype

### Medium-term (Month 3-4)
9. Google Drive/Docs integration
10. Format conversion engine
11. Beta testing with real users
12. Iterate based on feedback

---

## Conclusion

Docuscribe addresses a real gap in current AI tooling: **multi-document intelligence**. By bringing Cursor's agentic approach to document workflows, we enable research-driven writing, cross-document consistency, and change propagation that current tools cannot match.

The key to success is:
1. **Start simple** (markdown MVP) to validate the core value
2. **Focus on the hard problem** (multi-doc intelligence) first
3. **Add complexity incrementally** (cloud integration, formatting)
4. **Build trust through UX** (preview, undo, clear change tracking)

The market is ready, the technology is available, and the use cases are compelling. The question is execution.
