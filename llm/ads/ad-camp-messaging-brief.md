## Sorcery — Ad Campaign Messaging Brief

### Product
**Sorcery** — AI-powered document workspace for multi-document projects. SharePoint and OneDrive focused for launch (Google Docs and local desktop app under consideration for later phases).

### Core Product Story (Universal)

The three-act narrative that drives all messaging:

1. **You give an instruction in plain language.** No templates, no structured forms. Just tell it what you need.
2. **The AI finds and reads what it needs automatically.** It navigates your SharePoint or OneDrive, opens the Word documents it needs, and reads across your project to understand context, terminology, and what needs to change. You can see every file it opens before it touches anything. Point it at existing documents and it edits them. Point it at source material and it synthesizes something new.
3. **Changes stream in as live tracked revisions.** Your document opens and edits appear word by word — old text struck through, new text typing in — exactly like Word's Track Changes happening in real time. You step through each change and approve or reject individually. Nothing is permanent until you say so.

**The key trust signal:** Your `.docx` files stay in SharePoint or OneDrive. They don't move, convert, or get locked into a new system. Every change is written back as tracked revisions — compatible with your existing review process, version history, and co-authoring workflow.

### Universal Headline Direction
> *"Tell it what you need. It reads your documents, drafts the content, and shows you every change to approve."*

### Universal Differentiators vs. Alternatives
- **vs. ChatGPT/Copilot:** No copy-paste, no reformatting, no hunting for what changed. It works directly in your actual Word files in SharePoint.
- **vs. Google Docs / Word alone:** Those store files. Sorcery understands relationships between documents — reads across your entire project, detects inconsistencies, propagates changes.
- **vs. Notion AI:** Sorcery works with your existing `.docx` files in your existing cloud storage. No migration.

### Trust/Control Messaging
The anxiety with AI document tools isn't capability — it's trust. Sorcery is designed around: *you see everything before it's permanent.* Transparent process (you see which files it opens), live redlines (not a finished result you have to pick apart), your approval on every individual change.

## Per-ICP Messaging

### 1. Government Contractors (RFP Response Teams)
**Subtitle:** *"Tell it what to update. It reads across your RFP documents in SharePoint, makes the changes as tracked revisions, and shows you every edit to approve."*

**Example instruction:** *"Ensure the capability description on page 3 of the technical approach matches the past performance section."*

**Key pain:** 10–50+ coordinated documents, inconsistent descriptions across sections damage evaluation scores, 200-hour proposals, 30–60 day windows with high stakes.

**Key value:** Consistency across all proposal sections, surface relevant past performance automatically, save 60–80 hours per proposal, replace $20K–50K in consultant fees. One won contract = $500K–$50M.

**WTP:** $400–800/month

---

### 2. Grant Writers (Nonprofit Development Directors)
**Subtitle:** *"Tell it what to draft. It reads your research and past grants, synthesizes the content, and shows you every change to approve."*

**Example instruction:** *"Draft a 2-page program narrative for this funder based on our last three successful applications."*

**Key pain:** Narrative + budget + logic model + evaluation plan + letters of support must all align; synthesizing 10–20 research papers; same program described 5 different ways for different funders; academic-style citations across all documents.

**Key value:** Synthesizes research papers into coordinated grant documents, customizes for each funder while keeping core story consistent, saves 12–16 hours per application. Each grant = $10K–$500K in funding.

**WTP:** $200–400/month

---

### 3. Consulting Firms (Proposal/Deliverable Teams)
**Subtitle:** *"Tell it which proposals to draw from. It reads your SharePoint documents, synthesizes the best content, and shows you every change to approve."*

**Example instruction:** *"Update the executive summary to reflect the revised ROI figures in the detailed findings report."*

**Key pain:** Pitch deck, detailed proposal, case studies, team bios, pricing must all align; can't find relevant insights from past projects; brand inconsistency across consultants; partners spending non-billable hours on proposals.

**Key value:** Surface $500K+ of past project insights automatically, ensure brand consistency, save 24 hours per proposal, free up senior consultants to bill clients. One won project = $50K–500K.

**WTP:** $400–800/month

---

### 4. Academic Researchers (PhD Candidates / Early-Career Researchers)
**Subtitle:** *"Tell it what to check or draft. It reads across your dissertation chapters and research papers, synthesizes the content, and shows you every change to approve."*

**Example instruction:** *"Check that the methodology description in Chapter 3 is consistent with Chapters 1 and 5."*

**Key pain:** 5 chapters must be consistent in terminology, methodology, citations; 50–200 papers to synthesize; 100–500 citations across chapters; need to extract chapters into standalone journal articles; advisor feedback triggers cascading inconsistencies.

**Key value:** Automatic consistency detection across chapters, track hundreds of citations, extract journal articles from dissertation with citations intact. Saves 1–2 months on a 6-month dissertation.

**WTP:** $50–150/month (student budget)

---

### 5. Franchise Operators (Multi-Unit Operators)
**Subtitle:** *"Tell it what to update. It reads your SOP documents across all locations in SharePoint or OneDrive, makes the changes, and shows you every edit to approve."*

**Example instruction:** *"Update the opening checklist in all 12 location manuals to reflect the new supplier requirements."*

**Key pain:** Consistent SOPs across 3–20+ locations, franchisor audits for compliance, when one SOP changes must update 15 different location manuals, each location manager has their own "version," opening new locations requires recreating all documentation.

**Key value:** Update once, propagate across all locations; pass franchisor audits; reduce 40-hour SOP update process by 50%. Failed audit = $10K–50K in fines or termination.

**WTP:** $300–600/month

---

### 6. Legal Firms (Complex Litigation/Transactional)
**Subtitle:** *"Tell it what to coordinate. It reads across your filings and exhibits in SharePoint, makes the changes as tracked revisions, and shows you every edit to approve."*

**Example instruction:** *"Find every reference to Exhibit 7 across all filings and confirm they match the current version."*

**Key pain:** Complaint, motions, exhibits, deposition outlines, trial binders must all cite the same evidence; 100–500 exhibits across filings; cross-reference errors when exhibits are revised; associates spending non-billable time coordinating; can't find winning arguments from past cases.

**Key value:** Track all exhibits across all filings, auto-update cross-references when exhibits change, surface past winning arguments instantly, free up associates to bill clients, reduce malpractice risk from citation errors.

**WTP:** $500–1,000/month
