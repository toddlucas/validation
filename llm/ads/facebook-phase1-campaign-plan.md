# Sorcery — Facebook/Meta Phase 1 Campaign Plan

## Why These Two ICPs First

### Grant Writers (Nonprofit Development Directors)
Facebook is where nonprofit professionals live. Development Directors and grant writers follow funding organizations, nonprofit networks, and sector news on Facebook — and Meta's targeting reflects this. Job title and employer-industry targeting is precise enough to reach them cost-effectively. The pain point is emotional and scroll-stopping: every grant is a 12–16 hour synthesis job across documents that all need to say the same thing.

### Franchise Operators (Multi-Unit Operators)
Franchise owners and multi-unit operators are highly active on Facebook for both personal and business purposes. Meta has strong behavioral data on small business owners and franchise interests. The SOP coordination pain is uniquely concrete — "update 12 location manuals" is a real, visualizable problem that hits immediately in a scroll feed. WTP ($300–600/mo) keeps the unit economics workable if CPL stays under $60.

### Why Not the Others (for Facebook Phase 1)
- **Government Contractors / Legal Firms**: High WTP but these professionals concentrate on LinkedIn. Facebook targeting is imprecise; you'll overpay to reach the wrong people.
- **Consulting Firms**: Real pain, but the audience is diffuse on Facebook.
- **Academic Researchers**: Easy to target (university, grad level), but $50–150/mo WTP means the <$60 CPL goal still works for phase 1 — but conversion to paid is riskier. Add as ICP 3 if budget allows.

## Format Recommendation: Start with Single Image Ads

For Phase 1 fake-door testing, **single image ads** are the right call:
- Fastest to produce — no video production required
- Easy to A/B test: swap one variable per variant
- Lower CPMs than video in many placements, especially in Feed
- Facebook still delivers strong conversion performance on static creative

**Add one Reels/vertical video variant per ICP** if resources allow. Facebook is pushing Reels hard and CPMs are often 30–40% lower. A simple screen recording or text-on-video clip can perform well — no professional production needed.

**Placements to use at launch:**
- Facebook Feed (primary)
- Instagram Feed (same creative works)
- Facebook Reels / Instagram Reels (if you produce vertical video)
- Turn off Audience Network for Phase 1 (low-quality traffic)

**Aspect ratio:** 1:1 square (1080×1080) for Feed. 9:16 vertical (1080×1920) if doing Reels.

**Note on Advantage+ Audience:** For Phase 1, include one "broad" ad set using Meta's Advantage+ audience targeting with no demographic restrictions beyond country. Meta's algorithm often outperforms manual targeting on small budgets when given creative room to find its own audience. Let it run alongside your manual ad sets.

**Pixel setup:** Before launch, confirm your Meta Pixel is firing on the waitlist form submission as a `Lead` event (not just a page view). This is what the campaign optimizes toward.

### Ad Variations

**Ad A — Pain Hook**

> **Primary Text:**
> Every grant application is the same 12-hour process.
>
> Find last year's application. Pull the research you cited. Check if the numbers still hold. Rewrite the narrative for this funder's priorities. Then make sure the budget, logic model, and evaluation plan all still say the same thing.
>
> Sorcery is an AI workspace for grant writers. You give it a plain-language instruction. It navigates your SharePoint or OneDrive, opens the Word documents it needs, synthesizes the content, and returns tracked revisions in your document — ready for your review.
>
> Every change visible. Every sentence editable. Nothing saved until you approve it.
>
> We're building our waitlist now. Join below.

> **Headline:** Your next grant in hours, not days
> **Description:** AI workspace for grant writers. Works in your existing SharePoint and OneDrive documents.
> **CTA Button:** Sign Up

---

**Ad B — Outcome Hook**

> **Primary Text:**
> What if your AI actually opened your past grant applications, read them, and wrote the new one from them?
>
> Not a chatbot you paste content into. Not a template filler. An AI that navigates your SharePoint or OneDrive, opens the Word documents it needs, and drafts content consistent with your past work — as tracked revisions you approve line by line.
>
> One instruction. Your program narrative, literature review, and budget justification drafted together, from your existing files.
>
> Sorcery is built for grant writers managing multi-document projects. Your .docx files stay in SharePoint — no migration, no new system to learn.
>
> Now taking waitlist signups.

> **CTA Button:** Learn More

---

**Ad C — Specificity/Example Hook**

> **Primary Text:**
> "Draft a 2-page program narrative for this funder based on our last three successful applications."
>
> That's a real instruction you'll give Sorcery.
>
> It opens each application in SharePoint, reads them, synthesizes the content for this funder's priorities, and returns tracked revisions in your Word document — ready to review.
>
> Every sentence editable. Every change approved individually. Your .docx files never leave SharePoint.
>
> Sorcery is for grant writers who manage 10–20+ documents per application. Currently building our waitlist.

> **Headline:** Draft from your last 3 grants. Instantly.
> **Description:** AI document workspace for nonprofit grant writers. Works in SharePoint and OneDrive.
> **CTA Button:** Sign Up

### Image/Creative Direction

**Option 1 — Overwhelm visual (recommended for Ad A)**
A nonprofit development director at a desk, multiple Word documents open on screen, printed pages spread out. The expression is focused but overwhelmed. Warm, realistic photography style. Overlay text: *"12 hours per application."* or *"Tell it what you need. It reads your documents."*

**Option 2 — Before/After split (for Ad B)**
Left side: A stack of printed grant applications, highlighted and annotated. Right side: A clean Word document with tracked changes active — green insertions, red strikethroughs — clearly organized. Minimal, clean design. Headline overlaid: *"Every change visible. Nothing permanent until you approve."*

**Option 3 — The instruction card (for Ad C)**
Clean, minimal design. A single instruction displayed in a command prompt or chat-style interface:
> *"Draft a 2-page program narrative based on our last three successful applications."*
Below it: a Word document with tracked changes appearing. Background is muted gray or white. This works especially well as a short Reels video (2–4 second loop of the text appearing then the document populating).

### Ad Variations

**Ad A — Pain Hook**

> **Primary Text:**
> Your franchisor just updated the supplier requirements. Again.
>
> Now you need to find that change in the opening checklist. The closing procedure. The manager handbook. The training manual. Across all 12 locations. Each one a separate Word document in SharePoint.
>
> Or you give Sorcery one instruction: *"Update the opening checklist in all 12 location manuals to reflect the new supplier requirements."*
>
> It opens each document, makes the changes as tracked revisions, and shows you every edit before anything is saved. Review once. Approve. Done.
>
> We're building a waitlist for franchise operators. Join below.

> **Headline:** Update 12 location manuals at once
> **Description:** AI workspace for franchise operators. Your SOPs, coordinated automatically in SharePoint.
> **CTA Button:** Sign Up

---

**Ad B — Stakes/Compliance Hook**

> **Primary Text:**
> Franchisor compliance audit coming up?
>
> Sorcery is an AI workspace for multi-unit franchise operators that keeps your SOPs consistent across all locations — in your existing Word documents in SharePoint or OneDrive.
>
> Tell it what changed. It finds every document that needs updating, makes the changes as tracked revisions, and shows you each edit to approve before saving. Every location in sync. Every change visible and reversible.
>
> What used to take 40 hours of manual updates now takes an afternoon of reviews.
>
> Now taking waitlist signups.

> **Headline:** Every location in sync. Every time.
> **Description:** Keep SOPs consistent across all locations. Works in your existing SharePoint files.
> **CTA Button:** Learn More

---

**Ad C — Specificity/Example Hook**

> **Primary Text:**
> "Update the opening checklist in all 12 location manuals to reflect the new supplier requirements."
>
> One instruction. Sorcery opens each Word document in your SharePoint, makes the change in every one, and returns tracked revisions so you can review exactly what changed — and where.
>
> You see every file it touches before anything is saved. Every edit is yours to approve or reject.
>
> What used to take 40 hours takes an afternoon.
>
> Built for multi-unit franchise operators. Join the waitlist.

> **Headline:** 40-hour SOP update. Now 1 afternoon.
> **Description:** AI document workspace for franchise operators. Works in SharePoint and OneDrive.
> **CTA Button:** Sign Up

---

### Image/Creative Direction

**Option 1 — The map (recommended for Ad A)**
An aerial view or illustrated map showing multiple franchise locations (storefronts or pins on a map). In the foreground or overlaid: a Word document with tracked changes visible. The visual contrast shows "all these locations, one document update." Text overlay: *"12 locations. One instruction."*

**Option 2 — The overwhelmed operator (for Ad B)**
A franchise operator at a desk, binders and printed SOPs stacked around them. The expression is stressed, focused. Realistic photography. Text overlay: *"Compliance audit coming up?"* or *"40 hours to update every location manual."*

**Option 3 — The instruction card (for Ad C)**
Same format as Grant Writers Ad C — clean card showing the plain-language instruction, then a Word document populating with tracked changes. Works as static or a short Reels loop.
> *"Update the opening checklist in all 12 location manuals."*
This is visually minimal and works well in feed where text-forward creative stands out.

## Budget Allocation

| Campaign | Budget | Daily (30 days) | Per Ad Set |
|---|---|---|---|
| Grant Writers | $500 | ~$17/day | ~$166 |
| Franchise Operators | $500 | ~$17/day | ~$166 |
| **Total** | **$1,000** | **~$34/day** | |

**Campaign duration:** Run for a minimum of 7 days before making creative decisions — Meta's algorithm needs time to exit the learning phase. Aim for 50 optimization events (signups) per ad set before drawing conclusions. Given your budget, you will likely not reach 50 events per ad set in Phase 1 — treat this as directional signal, not statistical certainty.

**When to pause underperformers:** After $50 spend per ad, if CTR (link click-through rate) is below 0.8% or CPC is above $4.00, pause that creative and shift budget to the top performer.

---

## Success Metrics & Decision Criteria

| Metric | Target | Action if missed |
|---|---|---|
| Landing page conversion rate | >5% | Review landing page — the problem is likely there, not the ad |
| Cost per signup | <$60 | Pause ad sets with CPL >$90 after $100 spend |
| CTR (link) | >1.0% | Swap creative — try a different hook or image |
| CPM | <$30 | If CPM is high, test broader audiences or Advantage+ |

**Phase 2 trigger:** If either ICP hits >5% conversion AND <$60 CPL with at least 10 signups, move to Phase 2 prepayment validation for that ICP.
