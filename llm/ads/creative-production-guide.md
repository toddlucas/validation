# Ad Creative Production Guide — Phase 1

You have screenshots. This guide turns them into four finished ad creatives per ICP in a few hours, with free or low-cost tools and no design experience required.

## What You Need to Produce

Per ICP (Grant Writers and Franchise Operators), you need:

| Ad | Format | What It Is |
|---|---|---|
| Ad A — Pain Hook | 1080×1080 static image | Stock photo of overwhelmed person + headline text overlay |
| Ad B — Outcome Hook | 1080×1080 static image | Before/after split: messy left side, clean tracked-changes doc right side |
| Ad C — Specificity Hook | 1080×1080 static image | "Instruction card" — plain text instruction + your app screenshot |
| Ad D — Reels | 1080×1920 vertical video | 6–10 second text-on-screen + app screenshot loop |

Your screenshots are most useful for Ads C and D, and the right side of Ad B.

## Tools

| Tool | Cost | Used For |
|---|---|---|
| **Canva** (canva.com) | Free | Design all static ads |
| **Smartmockups** (smartmockups.com) | Free tier | Wrap screenshots in a clean browser/laptop frame |
| **Unsplash** (unsplash.com) | Free | Stock photos for Ad A (overwhelmed person) |
| **Pexels** (pexels.com) | Free | Alternative stock photos |
| **CapCut** (capcut.com) | Free | Reels/vertical video for Ad D |
| **Screely** (screely.com) | Free | Quick browser-frame mockup alternative |

Canva does nearly everything. CapCut is only needed for the Reels video.

## Step 1: Prep Your Screenshots (15 minutes)

Your screenshots show the product — the tracked-changes document, the instruction input, etc. Before using them in ads, wrap them in a clean browser or laptop frame so they look finished.

1. Go to **smartmockups.com**
2. Click "Try for free" → choose a template — use a **browser window** or **MacBook** frame
3. Upload your screenshot into the smart object field
4. Export at the highest available resolution (aim for at least 1500px wide)
5. Save as PNG

Do this for each screenshot you plan to use. You'll end up with 2–3 polished mockup images.

> **Screely.com** is a faster alternative if you just want a browser frame with a clean background — paste your screenshot URL or upload it, and it wraps it instantly. Better for quick one-offs.

## Step 2: Ad A — Pain Hook (Stock Photo + Headline)

This ad uses a photo of an overwhelmed professional, not your product. The product is described in the text, not shown.

**Get the stock photo:**
1. Go to **unsplash.com**
2. Search: `"desk documents stressed"` or `"office overwhelmed paperwork"` or `"nonprofit office"`
3. For Franchise Operators try: `"binders office desk"` or `"franchise manager"`
4. Download the full-size version (free, no attribution required for commercial use)

**Design in Canva:**
1. Go to **canva.com** → click "Create a design" → type "Facebook Ad" → select the 1080×1080 template
2. Delete the default template content, or browse their Facebook Ad template library and start from one that has a photo background style
3. Drop your stock photo as the background
4. Add a semi-transparent dark overlay (Insert → Elements → Shapes → rectangle, set fill to black at 40% opacity) so text is readable
5. Add your headline text — use a clean sans-serif font (Canva has Inter, Poppins, etc.)
   - Grant Writers: **"Your next grant in hours, not days"**
   - Franchise Operators: **"Update 12 location manuals at once"**
6. Optionally add a small logo or "trysorcery.com" in the bottom corner
7. Export: Download → PNG → 1080×1080

## Step 3: Ad B — Before/After Split

This ad is entirely designed in Canva — no photo required, though you can use one.

**Design in Canva:**
1. New design → 1080×1080
2. Draw a vertical line down the center (Elements → Lines)
3. **Left half** — the "before" (pain state):
   - Use a slightly desaturated or warm background color (#f5ede0 works)
   - Add a stack of papers icon or a photo of printed documents (search Canva's built-in element library for "documents stack" or "paper pile")
   - Label it with a small caption: *"Before"* or leave it unlabeled for a cleaner look
4. **Right half** — the "after" (Sorcery output):
   - Use a clean white or light background
   - Drop in your mockup screenshot from Step 1 (the tracked-changes document)
   - This half should feel clean, organized, controlled
5. Add a headline across the bottom or top:
   - *"Every change visible. Nothing permanent until you approve."*
6. Export as PNG → 1080×1080

## Step 4: Ad C — Instruction Card

This is a text-forward minimal design. No stock photo needed. Your mockup screenshot anchors the bottom.

**Design in Canva:**
1. New design → 1080×1080
2. Background: Dark navy (#0f172a) or off-white (#fafafa) — pick one and use it for both ICPs for brand consistency
3. **The instruction quote** — this is the hero element, centered in the top 60% of the canvas:
   - Use a monospace font (Canva has "Courier Prime" or "Space Mono") for the instruction text
   - Surround it with a subtle rounded rectangle card (slightly lighter/darker than the background)
   - Grant Writers text: *"Draft a 2-page program narrative based on our last three successful applications."*
   - Franchise Operators text: *"Update the opening checklist in all 12 location manuals to reflect the new supplier requirements."*
4. Add a small label above the quote: *"You type:"* or just a blinking cursor element
5. **Bottom 35%** — drop in your mockup screenshot, cropped to show just the tracked-changes portion of the document
6. Optional small label below the screenshot: *"Sorcery returns tracked revisions in your Word document."*
7. Export as PNG → 1080×1080

> This is your most versatile creative. It clearly communicates the product in one glance, and it works as both a static ad (Ad C) and the basis for your video (Ad D).

## Step 5: Ad D — Reels Video (Instruction Card Animated)

This takes the instruction card concept and animates it into a 6–10 second vertical video loop. Use **CapCut** (free, desktop app available at capcut.com).

**CapCut process:**
1. Download and open CapCut desktop
2. New project → set canvas ratio to **9:16** (1080×1920)
3. Set background color: same dark navy or off-white you used in Ad C
4. **Scene 1 (0–2s):** Text appears character by character (typewriter effect)
   - Add a text layer with your instruction
   - Apply CapCut's "Typewriter" text animation (it's in the animation panel → In)
   - Use a monospace font (CapCut has Courier New)
5. **Scene 2 (2–6s):** Your mockup screenshot slides or fades in below the instruction text
   - Import your mockup PNG from Step 1
   - Apply a subtle "Fade In" or "Slide Up" entrance animation
6. **Scene 3 (6–8s):** Hold on the full frame (instruction text + document screenshot visible together)
7. Add background music (optional — CapCut has royalty-free tracks) or leave silent (many people watch Reels without sound)
8. Export → 1080×1920 → MP4

**Alternatively, use Canva Video:**
Canva has an "Animate" feature on designs that adds entrance animations. Less control than CapCut but faster if you're already in Canva. Create the design → click "Animate" → apply animations per element → download as MP4.

## Production Order (Recommended)

Do Grant Writers and Franchise Operators in parallel — most assets are reusable with different text swapped in.

1. **Step 1** (mockups) — 15 min — produces mockup PNGs used in Ad B, C, D
2. **Step 4** (Ad C, instruction card) — 30 min — creates your clearest product ad; also becomes the video base
3. **Step 5** (Ad D, Reels) — 30 min — animates Ad C; produces the video variant
4. **Step 2** (Ad A, pain hook) — 20 min — find stock photo, design overlay
5. **Step 3** (Ad B, before/after) — 20 min — split layout design

**Total: ~2 hours** for all 8 ads (4 per ICP × 2 ICPs).

## Quality Checks Before Upload

| Check | Requirement |
|---|---|
| Static image size | Under 30MB (PNG/JPG) |
| Static image dimensions | 1080×1080 minimum |
| Video dimensions | 1080×1920 |
| Video length | 3–60 seconds for Reels |
| Video file size | Under 4GB |
| Text on image | Under 20% of image area (Meta enforces this — lots of text overlay gets restricted reach) |
| Font readability | Test by viewing on mobile at 375px width — if you can't read it, increase font size |

To check your image text ratio before uploading: Meta used to have an "Image Text Check" tool in the Creative Hub. It's been deprecated but the 20% rule still applies in practice — keep text overlays minimal and large, not dense paragraphs.

## Canva Tips for Beginners

- **Lock your background layer** (right-click → Lock) after placing it so you don't accidentally move it while editing foreground elements
- **Use the alignment tools** (top toolbar) to center text and elements precisely — don't eyeball it
- **Duplicate pages** to create the Franchise Operators version from the Grant Writers version — swap text only
- **Brand Kit** (free in Canva) — add your brand colors and fonts once so they're always available
- **Download at 2x** if the option appears — higher resolution is always better for ads
