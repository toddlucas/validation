Yes! What you're describing are called **device mockups**. They're widely used in marketing, portfolios, and app presentations. Here are some popular tools for creating them:

**Online tools (free or freemium):**
- **Mockup World** – huge library of free mockups
- **Smartmockups** – browser-based, very easy to use, drag and drop your screenshot in
- **Mockuphone** – focused on phone mockups specifically
- **Previewed** – modern UI, good variety of devices
- **ls.graphics** – high-quality free and premium mockups

**Design tool plugins:**
- If you use **Figma**, there are tons of mockup plugins and community files
- **Adobe Photoshop** mockup templates (PSDs with smart objects) are also extremely common — you just paste your screenshot into a smart object layer and it fits perfectly onto the screen

**Stock/asset sites:**
- **Envato Elements** and **Creative Market** sell premium mockup bundles
- **Freepik** has a large selection of free ones

The most common workflow is either using a browser-based tool like Smartmockups (simplest — just upload your screenshot) or downloading a PSD template and editing it in Photoshop. Figma has become very popular for this too if you're already working in that environment.
