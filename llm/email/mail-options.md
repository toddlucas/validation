Here are the options that tend to work best as you ramp (newsletters + product updates to subscribers, plus marketing capture for visitors), and what they cost as your list grows.

## How to choose (quickly)

Most early-stage businesses land in one of these buckets:

* **Simple newsletters + basic automations (best value):** MailerLite, GetResponse
  Good forms/landing pages, decent automation, predictable “contacts-based” pricing.
* **Big list, infrequent sends (pricing based on emails sent):** Brevo
  Great when you might have *lots* of contacts but you’re not blasting them daily. Brevo’s free plan includes 300 emails/day and stores up to 100,000 contacts. ([help.brevo.com][1])
* **Ecommerce (Shopify-style flows like abandoned cart):** Omnisend, Klaviyo
  Generally pricier, but purpose-built for revenue flows. Omnisend has transparent tier examples; Klaviyo is “active profiles + sends” and often becomes meaningful spend as you scale. ([EmailTooltester.com][2])
* **Product-led SaaS / event-driven messaging (very powerful):** Customer.io
  More like a messaging automation platform than a newsletter tool; starts at **$100/mo for 5k profiles** and includes **1M emails/mo** on the base tier. ([customer.io][3])
* **Creator/newsletter-first (can be $0 to 10k subs):** Kit (formerly ConvertKit)
  Their Newsletter plan shows **$0/mo up to 10,000 subscribers** (with limited automation). ([Kit][4])

## Pricing comparison at common list sizes (monthly)

These are *representative published price points* (USD) from vendor pages where available, plus widely-cited pricing breakdowns where vendor pages are dynamic.

### Contacts-based tools (easy to budget)

| Subscribers / contacts |      MailerLite (Growing Business) |              GetResponse (Starter) |                                   Mailchimp (Essentials) |
| ---------------------: | ---------------------------------: | ---------------------------------: | -------------------------------------------------------: |
|                  1,000 |  $15/mo ([EmailTooltester.com][5]) |  $19/mo ([EmailTooltester.com][6]) | ~$26.50/mo shown in breakdown ([EmailTooltester.com][7]) |
|                  5,000 |  $39/mo ([EmailTooltester.com][5]) |  $54/mo ([EmailTooltester.com][6]) |                        $75/mo ([EmailTooltester.com][7]) |
|                 10,000 |  $73/mo ([EmailTooltester.com][5]) |  $79/mo ([EmailTooltester.com][6]) |                       $110/mo ([EmailTooltester.com][7]) |
|                 50,000 | $289/mo ([EmailTooltester.com][5]) | $299/mo ([EmailTooltester.com][6]) |                       $385/mo ([EmailTooltester.com][7]) |

**Notes that matter in real life**

* Mailchimp can force you into higher tiers depending on automation needs; multi-step automations are typically on higher plans than Essentials. ([EmailTooltester.com][7])
* GetResponse has some billing nuances (peak active subscribers and contacts added in a month can affect charges). ([GetResponse][8])

### Ecommerce-focused (email + SMS + onsite widgets)

Omnisend examples (email-centric tier shown):

| Contacts | Omnisend Standard |                       Omnisend Pro |
| -------: | ----------------: | ---------------------------------: |
|    5,000 |            $81/mo |  $90/mo ([EmailTooltester.com][2]) |
|   10,000 |           $132/mo | $150/mo ([EmailTooltester.com][2]) |
|   50,000 |           $413/mo | $715/mo ([EmailTooltester.com][2]) |

### Event-driven SaaS messaging

* **Customer.io Essentials**: starts at **$100/mo** and includes **5k profiles** + **1M emails/mo**. ([customer.io][3])
  (This is why it’s popular for product-led SaaS: you can do lots of behavioral messaging without worrying about per-send costs early.)

### Send-based pricing (good for “large list, low frequency”)

* **Brevo** is priced primarily by **emails/month** (not list size), and the free plan includes **300 emails/day**. ([help.brevo.com][1])
* Published summaries commonly cite Starter starting around **$9 for 5k emails/mo** and Standard around **$18 for 5k emails/mo**, but you’ll want to plug your send volume into their calculator for exact numbers. ([EmailTooltester.com][9])

A quick way to estimate your send volume:

* Weekly newsletter = ~4 sends/month
* Monthly email volume ≈ `list_size × sends_per_month`
  So a 10,000 list with weekly sends ≈ **40,000 emails/month**.

## What I’d pick while ramping (practical)

If you want a safe “won’t regret it” path:

1. **Start on MailerLite** (value + features) if you’re doing normal newsletters, basic segmentation, landing pages, and a few automations. ([MailerLite][10])
2. If you expect **a big list but you’ll email rarely**, strongly consider **Brevo** (send-based pricing can win). ([help.brevo.com][1])
3. If your product becomes more behavior-driven (trials, activation, churn nudges), move/graduate to **Customer.io**. ([customer.io][3])
4. If you’re ecommerce-heavy from day 1, use **Omnisend** (or **Klaviyo** if you’re ready for higher cost/complexity). ([EmailTooltester.com][2])

## Don’t miss these ramp-up essentials (visitors → leads → customers)

Whichever tool you pick, make sure it supports:

* **Signup forms + popups + basic landing pages**
* **Double opt-in** option (helps deliverability)
* **Tagging/segmentation** (at minimum: source, intent, lifecycle stage)
* **Suppression lists** (exclude customers from “visitor marketing” blasts, etc.)
* **Automation basics**: welcome series + “product update” list + re-engagement

---

If you tell me two numbers, I can recommend a single best-fit stack and give you a tighter cost curve:

* expected list size in 3 months / 12 months (ballpark)
* send cadence (weekly? biweekly? plus lifecycle emails like onboarding?)
