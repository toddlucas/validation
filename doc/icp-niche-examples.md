2. **Created 200+ pages for ~15 main groups** (lines 182-189)
3. **Used Meta ads primarily** (lines 236-244)
4. **Focused on niche-down as much as possible** (lines 221-224)
5. **Prepayment ($5) was key validation** (lines 124-130)
6. **Every dollar earned went back into ads** (lines 473-476)

**His Formula:**
- Niche targeting → Low-cost signups → Prepayment validation → Scale winners → Reinvest everything

## 🎬 NEXT STEPS

1. **Choose 5 sub-ICPs from Phase 1 list above**
2. **Create landing page template** (use Lovable, Carrd, or Webflow)
3. **Customize 5 landing pages** (1 per sub-ICP)
4. **Set up Meta ad campaigns** (1 campaign per sub-ICP)
5. **Budget $500-1,000 per sub-ICP** ($2,500-5,000 total)
6. **Run for 7-14 days**
7. **Analyze prepayment data**
8. **Kill losers, double down on winners**
9. **Repeat**

The goal is to find your "real estate investors" - the sub-ICP that converts at $20-30 per prepayment with 20%+ prepayment rates. That's your beachhead market to build for first.
