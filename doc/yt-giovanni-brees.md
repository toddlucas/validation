# From Idea to $45,000/Month AI SaaS in 60 days | MeetOscar, Giovanni Brees

## YouTube video transcript

0:00
Today's guest, Giovanni Bree, has raised half a billion in crowdfunding. So, when
0:05
he built his own SAS, meet Oscar. He knew something most founders don't. We
0:11
even started with a budget of under $5,000. Now, we start to increase that once we start to see those pages
0:18
convert, subpages, and then we start to increase the budget. He made 200 landing
0:23
pages for 15 target audiences and made meta ads targeted so precisely that
0:30
signups cost pennies. But that still wasn't enough. If you made a small deposit of $5, you
0:36
could go immediately and get better list ranking. So the first validation is people sign up. The second one is they
0:41
are willing to pay. Only after people paid did Giovanni build anything. in just over a weekend
0:48
though and with zero dev experience. I'm not a developer whatsoever, zero experience, but I just start create and
0:54
start prompting. He scaled it to $45,000 in monthly recurring revenue in 60 days.
1:01
But the validation framework is just the beginning. Today, Giovanni reveals when
1:06
your customers are lying to you about features, how to avoid hiring yourself in a corner, and finally, how to make a
1:13
SAS and scale it easily. Let's get into it. I'm Victor and this is SASMastery.
1:20
Giovanni, great to have you here. Great to be here as well. Thank you, Victor. You're a New York City based founder and
1:25
you strive essentially at the intersection of growth systems and and rapid validation. That's what you're
1:32
what you're known for. So for more than a decade, you ran one of the top agencies uh to launch products, helping
1:40
to bring more than it's an astonishing number, 4,500 products to market, generating over 500 million in
1:47
crowdfunding and direct sales. Uh so through those brands, first boost your
1:52
campaign and uh now Max Capital, you have developed a reputation as the guy
1:58
of founders call when they need to test an idea, right? validate demand, turn that into traction without overbuilding
2:05
and without burning months in development. Uh so that mindset
2:11
essentially is what what led you to your next success we want to talk about today which is uh meet Oscar. It's an AI email
2:18
assistant you originally built to solve your own problem when you were overwhelmed by you know 100 plus emails
2:25
a day. So, in short, you took that pain, spun up a Lean Vibe coded MVP, and in
2:30
just two months, it grew to $45,000 in monthly recurring revenue, which is
2:37
pretty amazing given that you had no big team, no VC funding, just validation,
2:42
traction, and fast iteration. So, today I want to dig into that framework. how to validate ideas quickly, how to use AI
2:50
and and ads to generate traction, and how founders can avoid the trap you call
2:56
founders expansion disorder. So, uh, Giovanni, I can't wait to unpack this and
3:01
use meet Oscar as an example for all these topics. So, first, let's dive into the biggest mistakes either you have
3:08
made or you see people make on this journey. So, what does everybody get wrong about validation? Why is it so
3:14
hard and so uncertain? even let's say after you talk to 20 people and you're like yeah that seems like a good idea.
3:21
Yeah. So the first thing a lot of people um spend way too much time on the little things that don't matter. For example, a
3:27
logo. Logo is one of difficult things. They spend weeks on fine-tuning the logo, finding the right colors, finding the right brand name, but they don't
3:33
really know if their product is actually ready for market and if the feature set they have in mind is relevant for what
3:39
the market requires. So what I typically do and I did this for hundreds of different type of brands is I just type
3:45
the name of the of the company put some two nice leaves on top of the logo and that's my first logo. So that takes me
3:50
about probably 5 minutes in a PowerPoint and I literally print screen it and I throw it on the website. That's the
3:55
first thing. The second part is a lot of people ask friends, family, maybe a business owner they know but one or two
4:01
about their idea that they have and they call that validation. Now it's not bad to do that but it's not really the
4:07
validation we're looking for. So what we normally do and I did the same for meet Oscar is before I even build an MVP we
4:12
start with a landing page. It's a one pager very simple very straightforward again don't spend too much time on it just share what you need to share and
4:19
the basic information that you want to bring over to your audience and then send people to that page for meet Oscar we created first one landing page we
4:26
created a lot of variations of those pages depending on the different audiences and then we started um by having people sign up on a waiting list.
4:33
So that was our first step and again a lot of people go wrong there. They start building, start adding new features. We
4:38
are not ready to launch yet and start continuing with that before they even test it. So first most important part to
4:43
answer your question, validate test and don't spend too much time on fine-tuning everything. Just get a page that
4:49
converts. If it doesn't convert, look what the main problem is and try again. But don't spend too much time on those moments. But make sure you validate.
4:56
Absolutely. How do you then? because um as we just established, you know, uh calling up your grandma and asking her,
5:03
you know, is that a good idea might get you a yes, but might not get you a customer. So, what do you do differently
5:09
to actually test if the landing page convert? Who do you show it to or how do you get those signups?
5:15
Yeah. So, the first step is of course know really well who you're going to target. For me, Oscar, we had different
5:20
ideas of audiences and we actually discovered we never expected B2C to work and we noticed a lot of people really
5:25
don't like email. So for their Gmail for example B2C they even wanted to use MeetOscar as well. We then fine-tuned and
5:31
we found different audiences. We created different pages depending on the audience. That's step one. People sign up and we used mainly ads and we used
5:38
Reddit marketing a lot as well with more organic traffic. So for ads very simple we looked at CPL which is cost per lead.
5:44
How much did it cost to have one person sign up? Now signing up is very kind of them. But the second phase is we also
5:50
did a prepayment and a small pre-order. So there was no application yet. That's very important to know. It was just a
5:55
waiting list. But what we did is when you signed up, we started number thousand. So the first sign up which was
6:00
myself was,01,0002 and so on. If you made a small deposit of $5, you could go immediately and get
6:07
better list ranking. That means when we went live, you would be the first to use meet Oscar. What we basically did is
6:13
when you put $5 down up front, you would already be in the first 100 users that were on the sign up list. Because of
6:19
that, we then did a second validation. The first validation is people sign up. The second one is they are willing to pay small amount to get access to the
6:27
app. The third part is when they shared with friends, family, everyone they would like to. They got a referral link.
6:32
When they had five people sign up, they got something in return. And that's something in our case would be then for example two months extra access to meet
6:39
Oscar for free. But they had to bring people in. That was the important part. So we used that as a second valid or a
6:44
third validation phase. Plus of course it also helped us to grow our list organically. And then it started all
6:50
over. Sorry to because then people that signed up to the referrals, they then again had the offer to make a $5
6:55
payment, start sharing with others, and that's actually how we tested. So beyond sign up, which is important, put some
7:01
money down is usually really good proof that people really want access. Okay, wonderful. Uh, so many things to
7:06
unpack here. I love that. So meet Oscar, I think I just haven't mentioned it. basically and correct me if I I I'm I'm
7:11
wrong. Um is a tool that's drafting reply emails using AI in your inbox
7:18
based on the thread and information that they have on the customer and also documents that you upload. Right.
7:24
Correct. 100%. It's built for email. That's one of the differences. So it's not just a layer on top of CHP although
7:29
that's how we start to test the MVP. We build our own language learning model but yes correct. Okay. And so a lot of people they say
7:35
well you need to be in an industry you need to see a certain painpoint you can't just have an idea and then randomly you
7:41
know throw spaghetti at a wall and you said now this is precisely what we're actually going to do. So you you had
7:47
this idea of meet Oscar without a specific target audience in mind initially and then you said hey okay
7:53
well who could use this not like anybody but like who could be very specific ICPs
7:59
that could use this right is that how I understand it and then you said well that could be I don't know lawyers and
8:06
uh a few others and we'll build different landing pages to uh target
8:11
those different audiences we we think might be interested and and And you would run ads for those. Is that right?
8:18
Correct. And the main difference is it's a little bit in the communication style, but it's simple. When you talk to
8:23
lawyers, well, use lawyers as a picture. For example, silly things. Uh we target the support agents because we thought
8:28
that's going to be our biggest market, which turned out it was not. The lead time to sign them up was also too long. But in the beginning, well, we were
8:34
wrong. So we we also targeted support agents. So we had more people, you know, with the headsets and targeting support agents typically. Um that's so each page
8:41
have their own visuals and a little bit text that's relevant. Now, we used Lovable for that. So, we created one
8:47
main page and then we just chatted with Lovable with prompting and said like, "Hey, created a variation. Here's an image. Use that image. Create a
8:54
variation of the page." So, we created in the end over 200 pages. Now, that's that's a lot. You don't have to go that
9:00
far, but we really wanted to test as much as we could. And again, thanks to Lovable and other quick tools out there, you can make pages as if it's nothing,
9:06
right? It takes a few minutes to make changes on those pages. So, that's what we did. How many actual different ICPs were
9:12
those? And how many variations per ICP roughly? Um exact number I would have to check but let's say main groups about 15 and
9:18
then we had some subgroups because taking the lawyer example well you have lawyers that are working on their with
9:24
their own company one lawyer but then you also have lawyers that work in companies in groups and you have maybe lawyers more into insurance and we
9:30
really want to point out what is the audience when we build the application we are going after rather than everyone
9:36
can use MeetOscar which theoretically is true but of course if you say everyone it's no one and you can't target. So we
9:41
really start to niche down as much as possible. Okay. I love that. So you you really thought of a lot of different niches,
9:49
ICPs, but also within those what different types of people are there, how could we target them? Then you probably,
9:56
you know, AB tested CTAs and you also on those paid ads, you know, what made
10:02
people click. Um, 200 different landing pages, uh, and probably even AB tests on
10:09
those or at least AB tests on different calls to actions to those pages. That's
10:15
a lot of variations. Um, so if I'm thinking about running ads to those,
10:20
that sounds like a very high budget for a B2B SAS app. If I I don't know if I do
10:26
that level of detail and of testing, what do I have to expect to bring with me and throw at Google to get a useful
10:33
number of visitors so that I can actually say well uh it's not like this page got one visitor one click this page
10:40
got two that's not statistically significant right yeah so how we started and well budget
10:45
is an important one so it depends what is your budget availability but to talk low budget in this scenario um what we
10:51
normally do is we start with for example five pages Each page has your main most likely converting audience as the main
10:58
target. Also there niche down as much as you can because the more you can talk to this very specific user, the more
11:04
accurate you can target, but also your communication will be more relevant for an individual user. Um, of course, if you go too small,
11:10
you'll also notice it because then you might have really good signup rates, but very quickly the ad costs start to go up. The CPL in our case is scenario cost
11:18
per lead starts to go up as well because well, there are less people in in the target audience. then you might have to
11:23
open it a little bit but in the beginning niche down as much as you can. So we even started with a budget of
11:28
under $5,000. Now we start to increase that once we start to see those pages
11:33
convert then we created subpages and then we start to increase the budget. But even with a relatively low budget
11:39
you can do a lot of testing. Now it depends on your audience you are testing. For us meta was actually really
11:44
good source. The thing with meta is a lot of people for example Instagram are scrolling looking at pictures and so on.
11:50
So, you have to stand out. And for us, color with text worked really well. Not too much text, but just a CTA, a very
11:56
quick one, or little emojis, no email, plenty of email, and then a happy face,
12:01
for example. So, when people are scrolling, they click, they go to the page. We use some retargeting there as well. People that actually read the page
12:08
and spent some time on the page, those were the ones we throw in the pixel. A lot of people just put a pixel randomly of meta and then they retarget everyone
12:14
who spent two seconds on the page. We don't do that because that of course if you have intention but you don't sign
12:20
up. It's more about education and building trust. So we did some retargeting. We didn't use Google ads until we actually went live. Google ads
12:26
are great because you have search intent but the cost is also higher. So we went really low cost in the beginning with
12:32
meta ads. Okay. So you actually started with meta. I was assuming that was Google ads from
12:38
the beginning. Okay. And that's how Meta you would have used their automated
12:43
targeting to help you identify the right people too. No, we really set up the targeting based
12:49
on the interest and then we narrow down very specifically also on age groups and so on. Locations of course is a typical
12:54
one as well. Um Google ads we did some tests thing was so search intent was great. We got people to the landing page
13:00
which is amazing but then the sign up rate was less so and that's because they're looking for something now going to a flow of signing up start sharing
13:08
make a prepayment and wait on the waiting list. For us at least we noticed that we that the cost was too high to
13:14
get the same result compared to Meta. But again it depends on your audience. If you would have let's say distributors
13:19
a very specific audience and you have an application for distributors then I would say Google ad is most likely going
13:25
to be your best bet compared to meta ads. So, it's worth testing both. I see. Okay. Going back into your funnel
13:32
uh and looking at the next steps. So, you have a traffic source, you have an interested ICP, an attractive value
13:39
proposition, an intriguing call to action, converting landing page, and so
13:44
people are signing up. And then you already said what you do with those interested signups to further well that
13:50
shows interest, but it doesn't show readiness to buy. And so you're saying you have your weight list set up where
13:57
it says like yeah you can try this but maybe in a year uh you're at you know thousand we are letting in like 10 a
14:03
week or whatever if you want to jump the queue here's like a what was it $5
14:08
prepayment right and that is your actual validation and this is the number you're
14:14
then tying to each ICP probably so the most important thing is not how many
14:19
clicks how many all of that is like how many prepayments ments per target group
14:25
have I received. Right? That would have been the decision driver. And then what happens there is so some
14:32
groups had a lower signup rate or at least not the signup rate but the prepayment rate the validation phase
14:37
there. What we then would do is we send them another email follow-up email not selling but talking about how I use Mid
14:44
Oscar or the application in my own company. So but that was before we actually had a commercial version right. So but that doesn't matter because the
14:50
user doesn't know. We just talk about how great it would be to have the application and then we still made them
14:56
the offer to pay. Again, some audiences just need a little bit more time to connect and that has to do a lot to do
15:02
with trust because we created so many pages. Some of the pages honestly, you know, the footer wasn't really 100%
15:08
looking the nicest. And then you have people that are a little bit worried to pay online. You see that depending on markets as well. In US is much easier
15:14
compared to Europe. Europeans tend to be a little bit more sensitive with their credit card details. That means also for European market spaces, we would
15:20
sometimes add some more emails and then say like, hey, again, we still have the special offer available for $5, you can
15:26
sign up now. And we saw that those groups actually still increased and got to the same level of some other groups
15:31
that were just credit card heavier and easier to sign up. Mhm. Okay. Love that. I want to jump to
15:37
a product related question, which is, you know, I already touched on this a little bit, but I I mentioned that, hey,
15:44
you're obviously not a lawyer. you may or may not know a lot about the lawyer space or also about uh virtual
15:50
assistance or customer support or things like that. How do you then make sure okay you have the interest rate you have
15:56
prepayments right? So that means you you have captured some problem that's fine like you have hit something that is a
16:04
problem that is painful and that they're even willing to prepay to get solved. How do you then make sure you build a
16:10
truly useful product once you see that initial interest that you build the things they really need and you don't
16:16
build things that they don't need? I feel like that's especially if you're not deeply in this industry. This is the
16:23
hardest thing now. Would you what you think is and there are two factors. One is what people really need and then the
16:29
other thing is the ego of the team and the ideas the team might have and especially with the creative team it can
16:34
go everywhere, right? Um so we had a problem as well. We were thinking about WhatsApp implementations and Instagram
16:39
implementation, all the cool stuff there as well and features they definitely need. But what we then noticed is so you
16:44
have people on the waiting list. People start to ask questions as well. You can use that waiting list, a small group of
16:50
them. Don't blast it out to everyone, but take small groups in those different subsets and say like, "Hey, we're
16:55
actually working on some additional feature sets and we're going to launch soon, so you'll be the first to have access and so on." So always keep
17:01
enforcing that. What would you think is the most important? Now, for us, it was always very simple. It was the quality
17:07
of the reply so they don't have to change the email reply. And the second was security. No WhatsApp, no Instagram,
17:13
everything else. So we literally dropped everything and then started building the really basic MVP which was email replies
17:20
in your own voice. The third element which then came later. So that was on the list. The third part was that they
17:25
would for example for the lawyers or for the support agents doesn't matter audience that they can upload custom information of their company pricing
17:32
FAQs whatever it is. So MeetOscar would reply with that information rather than standard CHDP information because well
17:38
then they can just throw it in CHP and they get an reply as well. So yes, find your key features, put your ego aside,
17:45
don't listen always to the tech team and look at what is the most important and that's your key feature you start with.
17:51
Yeah, we we I think we've all been there, right? Uh built something that we thought was useful but really wasn't. Do
17:58
you have any frameworks that you use uh for like customer discovery or customer
18:03
personas or do you use like a value proposition canvas or do you have any any mental models to keep this organized
18:11
while you work with your different ICPs? So well we have some standard operating
18:16
procedures including then the lists of priorities. Um we don't focus as much on those. Those are actually very simple
18:22
where we just send out the email for example to the subscriber list and say like hey or a part of it and say like hey these are the top five features we
18:29
are building on and what do you feel is the most important. It's as simple as that part. Now the second phase is
18:34
actually more important for us and that's where a lot of companies in the second phase go wrong. So even if they get funding or even if they start to
18:41
lounge and they start to get monthly subscribers so they get cash then again the feature requirements come in where
18:47
people drop in a lot of feature requirements. What we then did, but now I'm already talking about we had the
18:52
first version of MeetOscar launched. What we then did is people started asking, "Oh, I want this and I need this and otherwise I can't use it and so on
18:58
and so on." He said, "Hey, no problem. We have a priority list. If you want for a yearly subscription, so if you pay for
19:05
a year up front rather than a monthly, we will move your request up in the list very quickly." We saw how important that
19:12
request really was for people. And of course, you also start to get a feel. If 100 people ask the same thing, there
19:18
might be something to it rather than one or two people yelling really hard about a feature. They definitely need 100%
19:23
need, but then they're not willing to pay a little bit for it. It's actually not really paying. It's more they take upfront one year, which we use as a
19:30
validation, but it's already the second phase for sure. It's definitely a bigger commitment even though they're not paying more overtime. Um given today's
19:38
trends really I I I was not surprised at all to hear that you vibe coded your first prototype. Uh what tool did you
19:45
use? Was that lovable as well for the main product? Was it lovable? Yes. At that time lovable we did a
19:52
little bit with replet as well for front screens and so on afterwards. But I started over the weekend in lovable in my way. So I'm not a developer
19:58
whatsoever. Zero experience but I just start create and start prompting at least I'm good in prompting and start to
20:03
create the front end and then of course use API. So the beginning the first MCV uh MVP sorry we launched was really
20:09
connected to ChatGPT's API. So was very simple. The API key was pretty easy to
20:14
hack and get publicly access to. So it was the most simple version you can imagine. That was the first version I
20:20
launched but again for that purpose was plenty. I see. Would you recommend a different tool today? You mentioned that you that
20:25
was back then you're looking into Replit. What is your current take on this? It's a tricky one. So I'm so used to
20:31
lovable so I keep using lovable but it's just habit. Uh, and there's the power of habit that wins. I think it's very
20:37
important if you're starting now, just look what Replit does, what B does, what Lover Ball does and look at how far they
20:43
are. Um, there is so much change and everyone catches up and then has one jump ahead of the other. It really
20:49
depends. In my case, again, it's just I'm so used to it. I keep using it for now. Yeah, I'm I'm used to uh lovable and
20:56
then also cursor depending on do I want to jump into code, do I want to not jump into code. I have never used Replit but
21:02
uh from what I've heard it's uh very much in between like you can get more technical than with lovable but you
21:08
don't have to be a full developer like with cursor but also if anybody knows
21:14
happy to get corrected on this one um what do you think say lovable or other
21:19
tools what they excel at but what are their limitations when building MVP
21:25
yeah so the main problem was security right so that's one of the difficult things it's pretty in the open a lot of
21:30
things. Um especially if you're not a developer, you can't also you don't have any idea what the code is about. So um I
21:36
noticed very quickly that well literally everything was in the open for an email tool for example that's not the best
21:41
approach and we would never be able to get CASA approved for Google for example and these kind of things and then let's
21:47
talk again about lawyers. Well we did have a security issue there in the beginning. So I think security is one of
21:52
the main problems and then the second part is but that depends on your developer skill as well. Of course if you are not developer like myself well
21:58
you just kind of build blocks on blocks and blocks to keep a nice structure and overview of what you're building and how
22:04
they're interlinking and then if you make one change how that actually influences the other. I was just kind of
22:09
building walls and trashing down other walls, you know, and then trying to fix whatever was was not working. But then I
22:15
got further in the loophole of having more problems that I created. So I think that's one of the main issues compared
22:20
to if you're a developer especially you have a nice structure you have a nice ecosystem and you can build it much
22:25
better but security is the main issue. Mhm. I would agree. Yeah. Uh obviously yes when you're a developer you can
22:31
influence certain things but also to a certain extent. Yeah. Uh iterations
22:36
that's the biggest issue I feel like as well. Cursor and others have gotten slightly better at this taking in more
22:42
context. Lovable ah not too much. So, uh I would agree. But for prototypes and
22:48
your first MVP, oh my god, is it good. Um let's talk about your launch now. Um
22:53
you have your weight list. You have um you you've fired up lovable. You've built that first iteration. You have uh
23:00
just validated what the initial feature set has to be and for whom you're building it. How did you then launch it?
23:06
Like what happened once you had this thing working and lovable? You tested it. what what were your steps to
23:12
generate the 45K in MR? Mhm. So, a couple of things. First of all, we start to release the weight
23:18
list. Of course, that's that's the easy part. We also offered upselles where they can become a VIP member, which was
23:23
much more than putting VIP in front of certain words like VIP support for example. But then they paid more. So,
23:30
that was great to test and to see as well. And then the second part, we started of course to increase ad spend. That was the important one. We made a
23:36
decision every dollar that comes in, we throw into ads. So we really focus purely on scaling growing as fast as we
23:42
can. Another tool that we started using was Reddit. So we started to post in Reddit, engage with people in Reddit, go
23:47
broader in in thinking pattern as well. So we didn't always throw meet Oscar out there but we literally helped people
23:52
asking about task switching for example. One of typical problems in in B2B is for a lot of people is they are um doing one
23:59
thing then quickly go to email then go to something else oh another email comes in start replying your focus. So we had articles and information about task
24:06
creaturing, how bad it is and how to solve that problem. And then of course me tasks would come up as one of the solutions for that as well. So more
24:12
natural flow that helped us a lot. We were able to build it out pretty quickly. And then ads. Ads really helped
24:18
us. We didn't do as much influencer outreach as we should have done because that would have been a third building
24:24
party where we could have of course get more visibility and reviews and so on. So we went mainly on ads and on uh
24:30
Reddit outreach and Reddit marketing. Okay. Okay. And you added Google Ads into the mix after you launch, as you
24:36
said. Okay, cool. That makes sense. Um, and then what's a good long-term strategy? Um, I see a lot of people do
24:43
that in the middle, right? And then long-term you go more organic
24:48
content based SEO. Is that something that you're planning to do now that growth is
24:54
getting more stable? Mhm. Yes, we are. So, we are working on the content side. Um again a lot now see
25:00
through our UTM tags that more and more referrals are coming also from chatdp for example. So we have been doing a lot
25:06
in the Reddit site again we're now working on Wikipedia page which is not the easiest but to get as much information also from us in Reddit. So
25:12
sorry in ChatGPT for example for searches. So that's one of the things we're working on and then of course difficult
25:18
SEO. So with the links and with the articles and offering quality articles so we are preparing the post to go live
25:24
in the next weeks. every week a few posts that we'll be launching long copy post and so on as well. So yes, definitely that's a longer term game.
25:30
Influencer side is another one that we are now working as well. And then again ads really keep working nicely and
25:35
referrals. So people that sign up and are happy are a great source to then share with friends, family, other
25:41
colleagues and in return for bringing in people, they get a discount on their next meet Oscar. They actually get free
25:46
months. So per person they bring in that signs up that's important. They get one month for free. And we see that that
25:52
actually helps a lot to keep growing as well our uh our whole business. Plus, each interaction because we're not
25:58
really selling to them, we notice that people are nicer in terms of replies. They will ask me some additional
26:04
questions or ask us as team some additional questions, maybe some tips and suggestions and they they get more and more kind of hooked in as part of
26:10
the company in a way rather than, you know, just paying each month. I love that. Uh, have you thought about
26:15
uh utilizing your viral loop opportunity with email? I don't know a premium but
26:21
it says in the email that that's was written with meet Oscar. I presume no paying lawyer client would ever want to
26:29
have that but maybe there's a way to utilize that. I think that could be killer growth. Yeah, it's a really good idea. We
26:34
thought about it. It's I think Dropbox and Swan did it in the past. Um Yes. The only it's not as easy, right? Yeah.
26:40
Yes. And like you also mentioned, some audiences would not really appreciate it. Of course, you can have a separate button to turn it on and then other by
26:46
default is turned off. is not that easy yet, but we are we are thinking about it. It's it would be great low hanging
26:52
fruit, especially in the B2C market space because they're well great um and then offer it as a premium solution, but
26:59
yeah, we're not out there yet how to implement it for the whole market space without having some problems with other
27:04
customers. Yeah, that makes sense. Maybe somehow because I see the the trust issue here.
27:09
Um let's go back to product. We were just talking about um the limits of VIP
27:16
code and so vibe coding things and so what was the breaking point when you figured hey I need to work with a
27:23
developer I can't keep vibe coding in how did you approach that who did you start working with
27:29
so for us it was pretty early in and so we start to have some limitations in terms of me trying to solve stuff and
27:35
then getting blocked and you know ruining more than I actually fixed but that was in one part also it's not my
27:41
focus point so it's not healthy to keep doing that. But then the second part was we needed for example CASA 2 approval
27:47
from Google and well forget about going that route if you have something built in in in my case in lovable. So I needed
27:54
very quickly with a developer to build our own platform our own version. The other part was also that we noticed well
28:00
depending on what ChatGPT does in an update well meet Oscar would also be better or worse of right um using those
28:06
annoying hyphens for example and these kind of typical things that chip does. So we didn't want it anymore. And we
28:12
also noticed that well email replies could be great spot on or not. The problem was or not we couldn't really do
28:19
much about it because what we can prompt against it but then other people would have a problem. So what we then decided
28:24
is it's time for our own language learning model. It's time to build something custom. So security was one of
28:29
the major first steps issues where people would ask you what's your security level? Well, we can't really have anything. Um and then also of
28:36
course to give easy access to Gmail where you just click approve with your Gmail rather than going through loopholes what we had in the beginning
28:42
we needed CASA to approval. So that was for us we didn't have any other option but then also product improvement right
28:48
the more users on board we start to get more problems where people say hey the reply is not really good anymore and
28:53
there was chip that changed not us but well is the result so we needed to come up with something new
28:58
got it and did you hire a developer did you work with a software house did you get a co-founder what what's the route
29:04
that you've taken so far in my case co-founder I like to sign up with co-founders as everyone has their
29:11
strength and as long as you have the right co-founder because much to say about finding the wrong one, but if you have the right one, everyone drives to
29:17
the same goal. So you you double basically your capacity and your willingness to really make it happen. In my case, um he's also a friend by now,
29:23
so that's great. Until now, you never know in business. But um from a developer perspective, so he's a developer specifically for AI and has
29:30
been working with language learning models for many different companies. The nice part and the lucky part is that
29:35
university students, which are his friends now, also helped us overnight and in the weekends and so on to really
29:41
build out. So we didn't really have to go through any let's call it third-party solution. We did everything in-house by
29:47
adding people whatever we could find. Then of course because we needed some more stability rather than saying okay
29:52
we have a bug. Sorry dear customer we can't help you because we can only work on Saturday we needed to hire al of
29:58
course of people. So then we start to hire as well. How big is your team right now? Six people on the developer side and three in the marketing side. And two
30:04
support actually most of it is AI support. So that's great but we still need some support for the bigger
30:10
companies we work with. For sure that makes sense. Um, do you feel you're already at product market fit or is
30:15
there still a way to go? Now we come with new ideas, right? So now we see new opportunities in new
30:21
market spaces where we see the opportunities to build out for example Instagram chat for smaller businesses um
30:27
link them to their to their stock orders for example and this kind of things. So you don't have to chat anymore with your
30:32
customers but MeetOscar takes over looks if items are in stock replies and and this kind of things. So now we are just
30:38
building out a more robust solution with more options and features as well. Of course, we also know that email and all
30:44
the the native uh language learning models for example for Gmail are also catching up. So we do have to make sure
30:50
that we keep growing and and build something that's bigger than only email replies. Okay. And have you been profitable from
30:57
day one or spending everything on ads? What what is it right now? Now we are definitely profitable. uh by
31:03
far our costs are pretty low and we scale nicely in terms of return on ad spend and so on. In the beginning, well,
31:09
it depends how you look at it. We didn't take salaries out. So, in theory, that's that's a negative, but we were actually pretty profitable from the launch moment
31:16
onwards as we even in the pre-launch because of the the the small payments, we paid back part of our ad spend. Now,
31:23
those were relatively small amounts, right? But what I just want to say, even if you don't have a big budget, you could launch and you don't have to worry
31:29
and try to find $50,000. It does speed up things definitely if you spend them right but you could do a lot with a low
31:35
budget and then for us as soon as we launched we were profitable but okay we reinvested everything we could just to
31:40
scale faster. Yeah for sure. Cool. I really want to um pick your brain on some mindset and
31:47
questions. Um you know the the story and journey of a founder right is is never a
31:52
straight line. And so can you share uh I don't know a story about like a low
31:58
point in your entrepreneurial career a moment where you know things almost fell apart what you learned from that
32:05
I have many but for other companies so I've been through them um that means for me does I didn't know as much but one of
32:10
the typical things that I had is you have a lot of ego problems where you think you can manage everything and then
32:15
it turns out you cannot second typical thing that I noticed is when I then started hiring in the beginning is I
32:20
would always go low budget because well I wasn't on low budget But I kept that mindset for many years afterwards. So
32:26
even when we start to be really profitable, I would increase my salary, but I would always forget not forget I
32:31
would help everyone and everyone got a better salary. But I didn't hire A players. Now once I finally learned to
32:37
hire A players, then I actually got ego hit once again because some of my A players were way better at things than I
32:43
was. So one of the typical loopholes that I or one of the typical things that I had is um was getting stuck with
32:50
finding people that could do the job but rather than people that would come in and just change part of the business and
32:55
really go to the next level. So I was kind of called in that loop of hiring but then kind of managing by hiring more
33:00
people had more problems as well. So I keep stuck and I was almost an employee in my own company. I don't do that
33:06
anymore. So now I try to hire as soon as I can a player before I pay myself out and then have that person take over as
33:12
much as I can to avoid me becoming an employee in my own company but really take leadership role. I have things that
33:18
I'm great at. I have things that I shouldn't be touching and I have things that I'm good at but I don't like doing
33:23
that counts for me as I shouldn't be touching them either. So I stay away as much as I can from those. So hire when
33:29
you can and hire well. I think that's a typical thing. And one more is also what I typically notice with a lot of people
33:34
we work with and that I did myself as a mistake. Hiring is one but then firing. Take time to hire but fire quickly. It's
33:41
always hard especially with your first team members. Even if they're really, you know, they are not a good fit. Just fire them as soon as possible because
33:47
you keep dragging it out. It keeps draining money and energy. And I have been doing that with some people in the beginning. I could keep them a year on.
33:53
But I would just be annoyed every single day. Right. So don't do that. Yeah. And it affects everybody else at the company too, right? Yes. Um,
34:00
wonderful. I love that. Thank you so much. Um, where can people find you? Where can people find meet Oscar if they
34:07
want to sign up? Uh, anything else that you want to share with our audience? Probably plenty and so many but we have
34:14
a limited time. Um, but if they want to find meet Oscar, meet us oscar.com. Very easy. We have free trial so they can try
34:19
it out. And then me, well, I just started I have Giovanni.com. Use my website. So if you have any
34:25
questions, you can always reach out. Love that. Giovanni, thank you so much for coming on. We pleasure. Thank you very much.
34:30
That was an incredible breakdown from Giovanni. Here are my three favorite takeaways from this episode. Number one,
34:38
stop obsessing over tiny things at the start. Giovanni calls this the founders's expansion disorder. He only spent 5
34:45
minutes on the logo in PowerPoint, and your first job isn't to build a brand. It's to prove someone will pay. So, stop
34:52
wasting weeks on things that don't matter and test your idea. Number two,
34:57
validation isn't a yes, it's a prepayment. This is the key. Giovanni didn't just get weightless signups. He
35:04
charged people five bucks to jump the queue before he had a product. A weight list shows interest, but remember, a
35:10
credit card shows commitment. And commitment is what we want. And three,
35:16
VIP code your MVP, but reinvest everything. As you saw, Giovanni is a
35:21
nontechnical founder who built his first version in lovable. really wasn't perfect, but it was fast. That speed
35:29
combined with reinvesting everything back into ads and later on into an actual rewrite is what fueled that
35:35
insane growth to $45,000 in monthly recurring revenue in just 2 months. But
35:41
if you're sitting on a SAS idea right now and you're not technical and thinking, "Okay, but where do I actually
35:46
start?" That's exactly why we built SAS Mastery. We help non-technical founders go from idea to launch in 2 to 6 months.
