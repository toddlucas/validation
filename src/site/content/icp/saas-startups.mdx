## Corporate Governance That Scales With You.

Your files stay in Google Drive or SharePoint—we add the governance intelligence on top. Whether you're just incorporated or preparing for Series A, we help you organize and professionalize your governance.

### Never Miss Board Meetings, Filings, or Option Grant Deadlines

- **Board resolutions and minutes** organized and tracked
- **Annual filings** automated reminders
- **Stock option grants** deadline tracking
- **Financing round documentation** organized by round

### Organize Your Corporate Chaos in Weeks

- Organize documentation from incorporation and all financing rounds
- Track cap table documentation and amendments
- Board meeting workflows and templates
- Professional governance without hiring a corporate secretary

### Save $5K-20K in Legal Fees During Due Diligence

- Investor asks for documentation? Send it instantly
- Clean records = faster fundraising
- No embarrassing gaps in DD
- Focus on building, not finding documents

## How It Works

1. **Connect your existing storage** (Google Drive, SharePoint, Dropbox)
2. **We organize by financing round and document type** with automated deadline tracking
3. **Scale from startup to real company with solid governance**

## Pricing

Starting at **$49/month** for pre-seed/bootstrapped, **$99/month** for seed-stage, **$199/month** for Series A+.

Compare to:
- Legal fees to reconstruct records for DD: $5,000-20,000
- One missed option grant deadline: Legal liability + retention crisis
- Failed annual meeting requirement: Corporate formality questions in DD
- Delayed fundraising from messy records: Weeks of runway burned

We pay for ourselves with the first due diligence you ace.
