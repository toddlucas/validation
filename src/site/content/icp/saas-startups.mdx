## Corporate Governance Your Investors Expect. Without the Overhead.

Your files stay in Google Drive or SharePoint—we add the governance intelligence on top.

### Never Miss Board Meetings, Filings, or Option Grant Deadlines

- **Board resolutions and minutes** organized and tracked
- **Annual filings** automated reminders
- **Stock option grants** deadline tracking
- **Financing round documentation** organized by round

### From Seed Chaos to Series A Ready in Weeks

- Organize documentation from all previous rounds
- Track cap table documentation and amendments
- Board meeting workflows and templates
- Professional governance without hiring a corporate secretary

### Save $5K-20K in Legal Fees During Due Diligence

- Investor asks for documentation? Send it instantly
- Clean records = faster fundraising
- No embarrassing gaps in DD
- Focus on building, not finding documents

## How It Works

1. **Connect your existing storage** (Google Drive, SharePoint, Dropbox)
2. **We organize by financing round and document type** with deadline tracking
3. **Impress your board, close your next round faster**

## Pricing

Starting at **$99/month** for early-stage, **$199/month** for Series A+.

Compare to:
- Legal fees to reconstruct records for DD: $5,000-20,000
- One missed option grant deadline: Legal liability + retention crisis
- Failed annual meeting requirement: Corporate formality questions in DD
- Delayed fundraising from messy records: Weeks of runway burned

We pay for ourselves with the first due diligence you ace.
