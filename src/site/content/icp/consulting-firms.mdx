title: "Win More Clients with AI-Powered Proposal Intelligence"
subtitle: "Multi-document intelligence for consulting firms—from pitch deck to detailed proposal to case studies"
painPoints:
  - "Pitch deck, detailed proposal, case studies, team bios, pricing all must align—inconsistent proposals damage your brand and lose deals"
  - "Want to reuse insights from past projects but can't find them—can't find that perfect case study from 2 years ago = weaker proposal"
  - "Each consultant writes differently, proposals feel inconsistent—brand consistency across consultants matters"
  - "Multiple partners reviewing, commenting, revising—version control nightmare with unclear source of truth"
  - "1-2 week proposal turnarounds while billing clients—partners spending non-billable hours on proposals instead of billing $300/hour"
  - "Need to create executive summary, board presentation, detailed report from same research—manual copying, sync errors, wasted time"

## All Your Proposals and Deliverables. Consistent and Intelligent.

Your files stay in Google Drive or SharePoint—we add the multi-document intelligence on top. Whether you submit 10 proposals or 100 per year, we help you surface relevant past work and ensure every document tells a consistent story.

### Surface Relevant Insights from $500K+ of Past Projects Automatically

- **Semantic search** across all previous proposals and deliverables
- **Find similar case studies** and client situations instantly
- **Reuse winning arguments** without manual searching
- **Institutional knowledge** that doesn't walk out the door

### Ensure Every Document Tells a Consistent Brand Story

- **Consistent terminology and messaging** across all consultants
- **Automatic inconsistency detection** before partner review
- **Cross-document updates** propagate changes across pitch, proposal, and case studies
- **Professional quality, every time** regardless of who writes it

### Reduce 60-Hour Proposal Effort by 40%

- **Save 24 hours** per proposal on document coordination
- **Free up senior consultants** to bill clients instead of writing proposals
- **Higher win rate = more revenue** without adding headcount
- **Better proposals = stronger client relationships** from day one

## How It Works

1. **Connect your existing storage** (Google Drive, SharePoint, OneDrive)
2. **Import past proposals and deliverables** to build your knowledge base
3. **Create coordinated proposals** with AI assistance maintaining brand consistency
4. **Generate derivative documents** (exec summary, presentation, detailed report) from one research base

## Pricing

Starting at **$400-800/month** for consulting teams.

Compare to:
- One 60-hour proposal at $100/hour: $6,000 in labor
- We save 24 hours per proposal: $2,400 in labor savings
- Partners spending non-billable time: Lost billable revenue at $300/hour
- One won project from better proposal: $50K-500K in revenue

We pay for ourselves with the first client you win with better proposals.
