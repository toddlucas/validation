title: "Win More Clients with AI-Powered Proposal Intelligence"
subtitle: "Tell it which proposals to draw from. It reads your SharePoint documents, synthesizes the best content, and shows you every change to approve."
painPoints:
  - "Pitch deck, detailed proposal, case studies, team bios, pricing all must align—inconsistent proposals damage your brand and lose deals"
  - "Want to reuse insights from past projects but can't find them—can't find that perfect case study from 2 years ago = weaker proposal"
  - "Each consultant writes differently, proposals feel inconsistent—brand consistency across consultants matters"
  - "Multiple partners reviewing, commenting, revising—version control nightmare with unclear source of truth"
  - "1-2 week proposal turnarounds while billing clients—partners spending non-billable hours on proposals instead of billing $300/hour"
  - "Need to create executive summary, board presentation, detailed report from same research—manual copying, sync errors, wasted time"

## All Your Proposals and Deliverables. Consistent and Intelligent.

Your files stay in Google Drive or SharePoint—we add the multi-document intelligence on top. Whether you submit 10 proposals or 100 per year, we help you surface relevant past work and ensure every document tells a consistent story.

### Surface Relevant Insights from $500K+ of Past Projects Automatically

- **Semantic search** across all previous proposals and deliverables
- **Find similar case studies** and client situations instantly
- **Reuse winning arguments** without manual searching
- **Institutional knowledge** that doesn't walk out the door

### Ensure Every Document Tells a Consistent Brand Story

- **Consistent terminology and messaging** across all consultants
- **Automatic inconsistency detection** before partner review
- **Cross-document updates** propagate changes across pitch, proposal, and case studies
- **Professional quality, every time** regardless of who writes it

### Reduce 60-Hour Proposal Effort by 40%

- **Save 24 hours** per proposal on document coordination
- **Free up senior consultants** to bill clients instead of writing proposals
- **Higher win rate = more revenue** without adding headcount
- **Better proposals = stronger client relationships** from day one

## How It Works

> *"Update the executive summary to reflect the revised ROI figures in the detailed findings report."*

*Start with a request in plain language — no templates, no structured forms.*

While the AI works, it navigates your SharePoint or OneDrive, opens the Word documents it needs, and reads across your project to understand context, terminology, and what needs to change. You can see every file it opens before it touches anything.

Point it at existing documents and it edits them. Point it at past proposals and case studies and it synthesizes the best content into something new. Either way, it's working with your actual `.docx` files.

*Changes stream in as live tracked revisions. Step through each one and approve what you want.*

### Review Every Change Before It's Saved

- Step through changes one at a time with Prev / Next
- Accept or reject individually — or accept all at once
- Nothing is permanent until you've approved it

**Your files stay in SharePoint. In Word format. Always.**

Sorcery connects to your existing SharePoint or OneDrive. Your `.docx` files don't move, convert, or get locked into a new system. Every change is written back as tracked revisions — fully compatible with your existing review process, version history, and co-authoring workflow.
