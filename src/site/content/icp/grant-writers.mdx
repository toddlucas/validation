title: "Write Winning Grants Faster with AI Research Synthesis"
subtitle: "Tell it what to draft. It reads your research and past grants, synthesizes the content, and shows you every change to approve."
painPoints:
  - "Each application requires narrative, budget, logic model, evaluation plan, letters of support—all must align perfectly"
  - "Must synthesize 10-20 research papers/reports into coordinated documents—spending hours manually copying citations"
  - "Same program, 5 different ways to describe it for different funders—inconsistent program metrics = funder questions credibility"
  - "Academic-style citations across all grant documents—can't track which source supports which claim"
  - "Multiple grants due simultaneously—ED, program staff, finance all contributing to different sections"
  - "Want to leverage past successful grants but hard to find relevant content—reinventing the wheel every time"

## All Your Grant Documents. Coordinated and Evidence-Based.

Your files stay in Google Drive or SharePoint—we add the multi-document intelligence on top. Whether you write 5 grants or 50 per year, we help you synthesize research and maintain consistency across all documents.

### Synthesize 10-20 Research Papers into Coordinated Grant Documents

- **Import research papers** into your project knowledge base
- **Semantic search** across all source materials
- **Extract quotes with proper attribution** automatically
- **Academic-style citations** maintained across narrative, budget, and evaluation plan

### Customize for Different Funders While Keeping Your Story Consistent

- **Same program, customized messaging** for each funder's priorities
- **Program outcomes/metrics match** across all documents
- **Automatic inconsistency detection** before submission
- **Cross-document updates** when program details change

### Reduce 40-Hour Grant Writing Process by 30-40%

- **Save 12-16 hours** per grant application
- **Leverage past successful grants** automatically
- **Better-researched applications** = higher success rate
- **More funding = more mission impact** for the community you serve

## How It Works

> *"Draft a 2-page program narrative for this funder based on our last three successful applications."*

*Start with a request in plain language — no templates, no structured forms.*

While the AI works, it navigates your SharePoint or OneDrive, opens the Word documents it needs, and reads across your project to understand context, terminology, and what needs to change. You can see every file it opens before it touches anything.

Point it at existing documents and it edits them. Point it at source material — research papers, past successful applications, program reports — and it synthesizes something new. Either way, it's working with your actual `.docx` files.

*Changes stream in as live tracked revisions. Step through each one and approve what you want.*

### Review Every Change Before It's Saved

- Step through changes one at a time with Prev / Next
- Accept or reject individually — or accept all at once
- Nothing is permanent until you've approved it

**Your files stay in SharePoint or OneDrive. In Word format. Always.**

Sorcery connects to your existing SharePoint or OneDrive. Your `.docx` files don't move, convert, or get locked into a new system. Every change is written back as tracked revisions — fully compatible with your existing review process, version history, and co-authoring workflow.
