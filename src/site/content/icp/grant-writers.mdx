title: "Write Winning Grants Faster with AI Research Synthesis"
subtitle: "Multi-document intelligence for nonprofit development directors—from narrative to budget to evaluation plan"
painPoints:
  - "Each application requires narrative, budget, logic model, evaluation plan, letters of support—all must align perfectly"
  - "Must synthesize 10-20 research papers/reports into coordinated documents—spending hours manually copying citations"
  - "Same program, 5 different ways to describe it for different funders—inconsistent program metrics = funder questions credibility"
  - "Academic-style citations across all grant documents—can't track which source supports which claim"
  - "Multiple grants due simultaneously—ED, program staff, finance all contributing to different sections"
  - "Want to leverage past successful grants but hard to find relevant content—reinventing the wheel every time"

## All Your Grant Documents. Coordinated and Evidence-Based.

Your files stay in Google Drive or SharePoint—we add the multi-document intelligence on top. Whether you write 5 grants or 50 per year, we help you synthesize research and maintain consistency across all documents.

### Synthesize 10-20 Research Papers into Coordinated Grant Documents

- **Import research papers** into your project knowledge base
- **Semantic search** across all source materials
- **Extract quotes with proper attribution** automatically
- **Academic-style citations** maintained across narrative, budget, and evaluation plan

### Customize for Different Funders While Keeping Your Story Consistent

- **Same program, customized messaging** for each funder's priorities
- **Program outcomes/metrics match** across all documents
- **Automatic inconsistency detection** before submission
- **Cross-document updates** when program details change

### Reduce 40-Hour Grant Writing Process by 30-40%

- **Save 12-16 hours** per grant application
- **Leverage past successful grants** automatically
- **Better-researched applications** = higher success rate
- **More funding = more mission impact** for the community you serve

## How It Works

<img src="/images/sorcery-screenshot.png" alt="Docuscribe Interface" className="w-full rounded-lg shadow-lg mb-6" />

**Three-panel workspace designed for multi-document intelligence:**

1. **Your Documents** (left) - Access all your files from Google Drive, SharePoint, or OneDrive
2. **AI Document Assistant** (center) - Chat with AI to synthesize research and coordinate grant documents
3. **Active Documents** (right) - See real-time updates and maintain citations across all documents

### Simple Workflow

1. **Connect your existing storage** (Google Drive, SharePoint, OneDrive)
2. **Import research papers and past grants** to build your knowledge base
3. **Ask the AI to synthesize research** and maintain consistency across documents
4. **Customize for each funder** while keeping core story consistent

{/* ## Pricing

Starting at **$200-400/month** for development teams.

Compare to:
- One 40-hour grant at $75/hour: $3,000 in labor
- We save 12-16 hours per grant: $900-1,200 in labor savings
- Each grant = $10K-$500K in funding for your mission
- Missing citations = grant rejected for lack of evidence base

We pay for ourselves with the first grant you win with better research synthesis. */}
