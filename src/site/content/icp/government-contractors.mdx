title: "Win More Government Contracts with AI-Powered Proposal Coordination"
subtitle: "Tell it what to update. It reads across your RFP documents in SharePoint, makes the changes as tracked revisions, and shows you every edit to approve."
painPoints:
  - "RFP response requires 10-50+ coordinated documents—technical approach, past performance, resumes, pricing, compliance matrix"
  - "Same capability described differently across sections—inconsistent information damages evaluation scores"
  - "Multiple contributors, constant revisions—unclear which version is current, proposal manager spending 40+ hours just coordinating"
  - "Must cite past performance, teaming agreements, certifications across all documents—can't track which source supports which claim"
  - "30-60 day response windows with high stakes—missing one requirement = automatic disqualification = $5M contract lost"
  - "Want to leverage past proposals but can't find relevant sections—reinventing the wheel every time"

## All Your Proposal Documents. Coordinated and Consistent.

Your files stay in Google Drive or SharePoint—we add the multi-document intelligence on top. Whether you're responding to a $500K contract or a $50M opportunity, we help you coordinate all documents and win more.

### Ensure Consistency Across All 10-50 Documents

- **Same capability, same description** across technical approach, past performance, and resumes
- **Automatic inconsistency detection** before color team review
- **Cross-document updates** propagate changes across all relevant sections
- **Compliance matrix tracking** never miss a requirement again

### Surface Relevant Past Performance Automatically

- **Semantic search** across all previous proposals
- **Find similar projects** from past wins instantly
- **Reuse winning content** without manual searching
- **Leverage $500K+ of past proposals** automatically

### Reduce 200-Hour Proposal Effort by 30-40%

- **Save 60-80 hours** per proposal on document coordination
- **Free up proposal manager** to focus on strategy, not document wrangling
- **Replace $20K-50K in consultant fees** per proposal
- **Better consistency = higher evaluation scores** = more wins

## How It Works

> *"Ensure the capability description on page 3 of the technical approach matches the past performance section."*

*Start with a request in plain language — no templates, no structured forms.*

While the AI works, it navigates your SharePoint or OneDrive, opens the Word documents it needs, and reads across your project to understand context, terminology, and what needs to change. You can see every file it opens before it touches anything.

Point it at existing documents and it edits them. Point it at source material and it synthesizes something new. Either way, it's working with your actual `.docx` files.

*Changes stream in as live tracked revisions. Step through each one and approve what you want.*

### Review Every Change Before It's Saved

- Step through changes one at a time with Prev / Next
- Accept or reject individually — or accept all at once
- Nothing is permanent until you've approved it

**Your files stay in SharePoint. In Word format. Always.**

Sorcery connects to your existing SharePoint or OneDrive. Your `.docx` files don't move, convert, or get locked into a new system. Every change is written back as tracked revisions — fully compatible with your existing review process, version history, and co-authoring workflow.
