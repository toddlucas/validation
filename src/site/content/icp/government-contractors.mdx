title: "Win More Government Contracts with AI-Powered Proposal Coordination"
subtitle: "Multi-document intelligence for RFP response teams—from 10 documents to 50+ coordinated files"
painPoints:
  - "RFP response requires 10-50+ coordinated documents—technical approach, past performance, resumes, pricing, compliance matrix"
  - "Same capability described differently across sections—inconsistent information damages evaluation scores"
  - "Multiple contributors, constant revisions—unclear which version is current, proposal manager spending 40+ hours just coordinating"
  - "Must cite past performance, teaming agreements, certifications across all documents—can't track which source supports which claim"
  - "30-60 day response windows with high stakes—missing one requirement = automatic disqualification = $5M contract lost"
  - "Want to leverage past proposals but can't find relevant sections—reinventing the wheel every time"

## All Your Proposal Documents. Coordinated and Consistent.

Your files stay in Google Drive or SharePoint—we add the multi-document intelligence on top. Whether you're responding to a $500K contract or a $50M opportunity, we help you coordinate all documents and win more.

### Ensure Consistency Across All 10-50 Documents

- **Same capability, same description** across technical approach, past performance, and resumes
- **Automatic inconsistency detection** before color team review
- **Cross-document updates** propagate changes across all relevant sections
- **Compliance matrix tracking** never miss a requirement again

### Surface Relevant Past Performance Automatically

- **Semantic search** across all previous proposals
- **Find similar projects** from past wins instantly
- **Reuse winning content** without manual searching
- **Leverage $500K+ of past proposals** automatically

### Reduce 200-Hour Proposal Effort by 30-40%

- **Save 60-80 hours** per proposal on document coordination
- **Free up proposal manager** to focus on strategy, not document wrangling
- **Replace $20K-50K in consultant fees** per proposal
- **Better consistency = higher evaluation scores** = more wins

## How It Works

<img src="/images/sorcery-screenshot.png" alt="Docuscribe Interface" className="w-full rounded-lg shadow-lg mb-6" />

**Three-panel workspace designed for multi-document intelligence:**

1. **Your Documents** (left) - Access all your files from SharePoint, Google Drive, or OneDrive
2. **AI Document Assistant** (center) - Chat with AI to edit, analyze, and coordinate across documents
3. **Active Documents** (right) - See real-time updates and track changes across your document set

### Simple Workflow

1. **Connect your existing storage** (Google Drive, SharePoint, OneDrive)
2. **Import past proposals** to build your knowledge base
3. **Ask the AI to coordinate changes** across all RFP documents
4. **Review and approve updates** before they're applied

{/* ## Pricing

Starting at **$400-800/month** for proposal teams.

Compare to:
- One 200-hour proposal at $100/hour: $20,000 in labor
- We save 60-80 hours per proposal: $6,000-8,000 in labor savings
- One lost contract from inconsistent documents: $500K-$50M in lost revenue
- Consultant fees per proposal: $20,000-50,000

We pay for ourselves with the first contract you win with better proposals. */}
