title: "Win More Cases with AI-Powered Legal Document Coordination"
subtitle: "Tell it what to coordinate. It reads across your filings and exhibits in SharePoint, makes the changes as tracked revisions, and shows you every edit to approve."
painPoints:
  - "Complaint, motion, exhibits, deposition outlines, trial binders all must cite same evidence—citation error in motion = credibility damaged with judge = case weakened"
  - "100-500 exhibits across multiple filings—cross-referencing: 'As stated in Exhibit A...' but Exhibit A was revised"
  - "Multiple attorneys working on same matter—unclear which version is current, associates spending non-billable time coordinating documents"
  - "Need to create summary judgment motion from discovery responses—manual copying, sync errors, wasted billable hours"
  - "Want to reuse legal arguments from past cases but can't find them—can't find similar argument from past case = reinventing the wheel = wasted billable hours"
  - "Court deadlines, opposing counsel deadlines—fewer errors in citations = lower malpractice risk"

## All Your Legal Filings. Coordinated and Citation-Perfect.

Your files stay in Google Drive, SharePoint, or NetDocuments—we add the multi-document intelligence on top. Whether you handle 10 matters or 200 per year, we help you ensure every filing cites the right evidence and every argument is consistent.

### Ensure Every Filing Cites the Right Evidence Consistently

- **Track 100-500 exhibits** across multiple filings
- **Automatic cross-reference updates** when exhibits are revised
- **Citation accuracy** maintained across complaint, motions, and trial binders
- **Fewer errors = lower malpractice risk** and stronger credibility with judges

### Reuse Winning Arguments from $1M+ of Past Cases Automatically

- **Semantic search** across all previous matters
- **Find similar legal arguments** and precedents instantly
- **Reuse winning briefs** without manual searching
- **Institutional knowledge** that doesn't walk out the door with departing attorneys

### Free Up Attorneys to Bill Clients Instead of Coordinating Documents

- **Associates spend time on legal research**, not tracking exhibits
- **Partners focus on strategy**, not version control
- **Stronger legal arguments = better outcomes** for clients
- **Better outcomes = reputation = more business**

## How It Works

> *"Find every reference to Exhibit 7 across all filings and confirm they match the current version."*

*Start with a request in plain language — no templates, no structured forms.*

While the AI works, it navigates your SharePoint, opens the Word documents it needs across every filing and exhibit, and reads them to understand context, citations, and what needs to change. You can see every file it opens before it touches anything.

Point it at existing filings and it coordinates the changes. Point it at discovery responses and it synthesizes them into a draft motion. Either way, it's working with your actual `.docx` files.

*Changes stream in as live tracked revisions. Step through each one and approve what you want.*

### Review Every Change Before It's Saved

- Step through changes one at a time with Prev / Next
- Accept or reject individually — or accept all at once
- Nothing is permanent until you've approved it

**Your files stay in SharePoint. In Word format. Always.**

Sorcery connects to your existing SharePoint or OneDrive. Your `.docx` files don't move, convert, or get locked into a new system. Every change is written back as tracked revisions — fully compatible with your existing review process, version history, and matter management workflow.
