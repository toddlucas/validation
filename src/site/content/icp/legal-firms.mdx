title: "Win More Cases with AI-Powered Legal Document Coordination"
subtitle: "Multi-document intelligence for law firms—from complaint to exhibits to trial binders"
painPoints:
  - "Complaint, motion, exhibits, deposition outlines, trial binders all must cite same evidence—citation error in motion = credibility damaged with judge = case weakened"
  - "100-500 exhibits across multiple filings—cross-referencing: 'As stated in Exhibit A...' but Exhibit A was revised"
  - "Multiple attorneys working on same matter—unclear which version is current, associates spending non-billable time coordinating documents"
  - "Need to create summary judgment motion from discovery responses—manual copying, sync errors, wasted billable hours"
  - "Want to reuse legal arguments from past cases but can't find them—can't find similar argument from past case = reinventing the wheel = wasted billable hours"
  - "Court deadlines, opposing counsel deadlines—fewer errors in citations = lower malpractice risk"

## All Your Legal Filings. Coordinated and Citation-Perfect.

Your files stay in Google Drive, SharePoint, or NetDocuments—we add the multi-document intelligence on top. Whether you handle 10 matters or 200 per year, we help you ensure every filing cites the right evidence and every argument is consistent.

### Ensure Every Filing Cites the Right Evidence Consistently

- **Track 100-500 exhibits** across multiple filings
- **Automatic cross-reference updates** when exhibits are revised
- **Citation accuracy** maintained across complaint, motions, and trial binders
- **Fewer errors = lower malpractice risk** and stronger credibility with judges

### Reuse Winning Arguments from $1M+ of Past Cases Automatically

- **Semantic search** across all previous matters
- **Find similar legal arguments** and precedents instantly
- **Reuse winning briefs** without manual searching
- **Institutional knowledge** that doesn't walk out the door with departing attorneys

### Free Up Attorneys to Bill Clients Instead of Coordinating Documents

- **Associates spend time on legal research**, not tracking exhibits
- **Partners focus on strategy**, not version control
- **Stronger legal arguments = better outcomes** for clients
- **Better outcomes = reputation = more business**

## How It Works

<img src="/images/manuscript-screenshot.png" alt="Docuscribe Interface" className="w-full rounded-lg shadow-lg mb-6" />

**Three-panel workspace designed for multi-document intelligence:**

1. **Your Documents** (left) - Access all your files from SharePoint, NetDocuments, or iManage
2. **AI Document Assistant** (center) - Chat with AI to coordinate filings and manage exhibits
3. **Active Documents** (right) - See real-time updates and track citations across all filings

### Simple Workflow

1. **Connect your existing storage** (Google Drive, SharePoint, NetDocuments, iManage)
2. **Import past cases and filings** to build your knowledge base
3. **Ask the AI to find similar arguments** and coordinate citations across filings
4. **Generate derivative documents** (summary judgment motion from discovery responses)

{/* ## Pricing

Starting at **$500-1,000/month** for litigation teams.

Compare to:
- Associates spending non-billable time coordinating: Lost billable revenue at $200-400/hour
- Citation error leading to malpractice claim: $50K-500K+ in damages
- Can't find past argument: Wasted billable hours reinventing the wheel
- Better outcomes for clients: Reputation and referrals

We pay for ourselves with the billable hours you save and the malpractice risk you avoid. */}
