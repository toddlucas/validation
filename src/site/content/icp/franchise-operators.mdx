title: "Keep All Your Locations Consistent with AI-Powered SOP Management"
subtitle: "Tell it what to update. It reads your SOP documents across all locations in SharePoint or OneDrive, makes the changes, and shows you every edit to approve."
painPoints:
  - "Need consistent SOPs across all locations but each location has slight variations—failed franchisor audit = $10K-50K in fines or franchise termination"
  - "Employee handbook, training videos, checklists must all align—inconsistent operations across locations = brand reputation damage"
  - "Franchisor requires specific documentation, audits for consistency—when SOP changes, must update 15 different location manuals"
  - "Opening new location requires recreating all documentation—spending entire weekends updating SOPs across 15 locations manually"
  - "Each location manager has their own 'version' of the SOP—unclear which version is current, compliance nightmare"
  - "Best practices from Location A need to be documented and shared with Location B-Z—can't scale to 20+ locations without drowning in documentation chaos"

## All Your Location SOPs. Consistent and Compliant.

Your files stay in Google Drive or SharePoint—we add the multi-document intelligence on top. Whether you operate 3 locations or 20+, we help you update all locations simultaneously and ensure franchisor compliance.

### Update All Locations Simultaneously When SOPs Change

- **Update once, apply everywhere** across all location manuals
- **Automatic propagation** of SOP changes to all locations
- **Preview all changes** before applying to ensure accuracy
- **Version control** so you always know which is current

### Ensure Franchisor Compliance Across Every Location

- **Compliance matrix tracking** for franchisor requirements
- **Automated deadline reminders** for audits and filings
- **Documentation always accessible** when franchisor audits
- **Pass audits = avoid $10K-50K in fines** or franchise termination

### Reduce 40-Hour SOP Update Process by 50%

- **Save 20 hours** per major SOP update
- **Open new locations faster** with documented, consistent processes
- **Scale to 20+ locations** without documentation chaos
- **Employee handbook, training materials, checklists** all stay aligned

## How It Works

> *"Update the opening checklist in all 12 location manuals to reflect the new supplier requirements."*

*Start with a request in plain language — no templates, no structured forms.*

While the AI works, it navigates your SharePoint or OneDrive, opens the Word documents it needs across every location folder, and reads them to understand what needs to change and where. You can see every file it opens before it touches anything.

Point it at existing SOPs and it propagates the changes. Point it at franchisor requirements and it updates your documentation to match. Either way, it's working with your actual `.docx` files.

*Changes stream in as live tracked revisions. Step through each one and approve what you want.*

### Review Every Change Before It's Saved

- Step through changes one at a time with Prev / Next
- Accept or reject individually — or accept all at once
- Nothing is permanent until you've approved it

**Your files stay in SharePoint or OneDrive. In Word format. Always.**

Sorcery connects to your existing SharePoint or OneDrive. Your `.docx` files don't move, convert, or get locked into a new system. Every change is written back as tracked revisions — fully compatible with your existing review process, version history, and location manager sharing workflow.
