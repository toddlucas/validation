subtitle: "Multi-document intelligence for multi-unit franchise operators—from 3 locations to 20+ units"
painPoints:
  - "Need consistent SOPs across all locations but each location has slight variations—failed franchisor audit = $10K-50K in fines or franchise termination"
  - "Employee handbook, training videos, checklists must all align—inconsistent operations across locations = brand reputation damage"
  - "Franchisor requires specific documentation, audits for consistency—when SOP changes, must update 15 different location manuals"
  - "Opening new location requires recreating all documentation—spending entire weekends updating SOPs across 15 locations manually"
  - "Each location manager has their own 'version' of the SOP—unclear which version is current, compliance nightmare"
  - "Best practices from Location A need to be documented and shared with Location B-Z—can't scale to 20+ locations without drowning in documentation chaos"

## All Your Location SOPs. Consistent and Compliant.

Your files stay in Google Drive or SharePoint—we add the multi-document intelligence on top. Whether you operate 3 locations or 20+, we help you update all locations simultaneously and ensure franchisor compliance.

### Update All Locations Simultaneously When SOPs Change

- **Update once, apply everywhere** across all location manuals
- **Automatic propagation** of SOP changes to all locations
- **Preview all changes** before applying to ensure accuracy
- **Version control** so you always know which is current

### Ensure Franchisor Compliance Across Every Location

- **Compliance matrix tracking** for franchisor requirements
- **Automated deadline reminders** for audits and filings
- **Documentation always accessible** when franchisor audits
- **Pass audits = avoid $10K-50K in fines** or franchise termination

### Reduce 40-Hour SOP Update Process by 50%

- **Save 20 hours** per major SOP update
- **Open new locations faster** with documented, consistent processes
- **Scale to 20+ locations** without documentation chaos
- **Employee handbook, training materials, checklists** all stay aligned
