## How It Works

1. **Connect your existing storage** (Google Drive, SharePoint, Dropbox)
2. **We organize by entity and property** with deadline tracking
3. **Never lose a document or miss a deadline again**

## Pricing

Starting at **$49/month** for single entity, **$99/month** for up to 3 properties/LLCs.
