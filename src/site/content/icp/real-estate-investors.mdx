## All Your Property Documents. Organized in One Place.

Your files stay in Google Drive or SharePoint—we add the governance intelligence on top. Whether you have one property or ten, we help you stay organized and never miss a deadline.

### Never Miss Another Deadline

- **Lease renewals** tracked across all properties
- **LLC annual filings** automated reminders for each entity
- **Contract expirations** never auto-renew at worse terms again
- **Insurance renewals** no more coverage gaps

### Find Any Document in 10 Seconds

- Search all your property documents instantly
- Filter by property, LLC, or document type
- No more searching multiple Drive folders
- Track which LLC owns which property (for multi-property investors)

### Organized Records = Faster Deals

- Lender asks for documents? Send them instantly
- Refinancing moves faster with organized records
- Property sales close without document delays
- Save $5K-20K in legal fees reconstructing records

## How It Works

1. **Connect your existing storage** (Google Drive, SharePoint, Dropbox)
2. **We organize by property and entity** with automated deadline tracking
3. **Scale from one property to 10+ without the paperwork chaos**

## Pricing

Starting at **$49/month** for single entity, **$99/month** for several, and **$199/month** for unlimited.

Compare to:
- One missed LLC filing penalty: $500-2,000
