title: "Finish Your Dissertation Faster with AI-Powered Multi-Document Coordination"
subtitle: "Tell it what to check or draft. It reads across your dissertation chapters and research papers, synthesizes the content, and shows you every change to approve."
painPoints:
  - "5 chapters that must be consistent in terminology, methodology, citations—advisor finds inconsistency = major revision = delayed graduation"
  - "50-200 papers to synthesize across multiple documents—spending weeks manually ensuring methodology is described the same way everywhere"
  - "100-500 citations across dissertation chapters—can't track which citation is in which chapter = citation errors = credibility damaged"
  - "Need to extract dissertation chapters into standalone journal articles—manual copying, sync errors when chapters change"
  - "Methodology described differently in Chapter 3 vs. Chapter 5—cross-referencing: 'As discussed in Chapter 2...' but Chapter 2 changed"
  - "Advisor feedback, multiple revisions—unclear which version is current, need to publish 3-5 papers from dissertation for job market"

## How It Works

> *"Check that the methodology description in Chapter 3 is consistent with Chapters 1 and 5."*

*Start with a request in plain language — no templates, no structured forms.*

While the AI works, it navigates your OneDrive or SharePoint, opens the Word documents it needs, and reads across your project to understand context, terminology, and what needs to change. You can see every file it opens before it touches anything.

Point it at existing chapters and it checks or edits them. Point it at your research papers and it synthesizes findings into new content — with citations. Either way, it's working with your actual `.docx` files.

*Changes stream in as live tracked revisions. Step through each one and approve what you want.*

### Review Every Change Before It's Saved

- Step through changes one at a time with Prev / Next
- Accept or reject individually — or accept all at once
- Nothing is permanent until you've approved it

**Your files stay in OneDrive. In Word format. Always.**

Sorcery connects to your existing OneDrive or SharePoint. Your `.docx` files don't move, convert, or get locked into a new system. Every change is written back as tracked revisions — fully compatible with your existing review process, version history, and advisor sharing workflow.
