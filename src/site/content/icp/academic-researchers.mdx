title: "Finish Your Dissertation Faster with AI-Powered Multi-Document Coordination"
subtitle: "Multi-document intelligence for PhD candidates and early-career researchers—from 5 chapters to journal articles"
painPoints:
  - "5 chapters that must be consistent in terminology, methodology, citations—advisor finds inconsistency = major revision = delayed graduation"
  - "50-200 papers to synthesize across multiple documents—spending weeks manually ensuring methodology is described the same way everywhere"
  - "100-500 citations across dissertation chapters—can't track which citation is in which chapter = citation errors = credibility damaged"
  - "Need to extract dissertation chapters into standalone journal articles—manual copying, sync errors when chapters change"
  - "Methodology described differently in Chapter 3 vs. Chapter 5—cross-referencing: 'As discussed in Chapter 2...' but Chapter 2 changed"
  - "Advisor feedback, multiple revisions—unclear which version is current, need to publish 3-5 papers from dissertation for job market"
