## Quick Start: Free Stock Photo Sources

### Recommended Sites (All Free, High Quality):
1. **Unsplash** (unsplash.com) - Best for authentic, high-quality images
2. **Pexels** (pexels.com) - Great for business and professional images
3. **Pixabay** (pixabay.com) - Good backup option

### Search Strategy:
1. Start with specific terms (e.g., "real estate portfolio")
2. If too specific, broaden (e.g., "property management")
3. Look for images with:
   - Professional quality
   - Good lighting
   - Clean composition
   - Room for text overlay on right side

### Image Editing (Basic):
- Use **Canva** (free) to resize and optimize
- Add subtle overlay if needed for text readability
- Compress using **TinyPNG** before uploading

## Placeholder Images (If Needed)

If you need to launch quickly without custom images, use solid color backgrounds with subtle patterns:

```css
/* Real Estate - Blue gradient */
background: linear-gradient(135deg, #1e3a8a 0%, #3b82f6 100%);

/* E-commerce - Purple gradient */
background: linear-gradient(135deg, #7c3aed 0%, #a78bfa 100%);

/* Franchise - Red gradient */
background: linear-gradient(135deg, #dc2626 0%, #f87171 100%);

/* Family Business - Brown/Green gradient */
background: linear-gradient(135deg, #92400e 0%, #047857 100%);

/* SaaS - Blue/Purple gradient */
background: linear-gradient(135deg, #2563eb 0%, #8b5cf6 100%);
```

Add subtle pattern overlay for texture.

## Next Steps

1. **Source or create images** using guidance above
2. **Save to** `/public/images/` directory with exact filenames:
   - `hero-real-estate.jpg`
   - `hero-ecommerce.jpg`
   - `hero-franchise.jpg`
   - `hero-family-business.jpg`
   - `hero-saas-startup.jpg`
3. **Optimize** images to <200KB using TinyPNG
4. **Test** on actual landing pages for text overlay readability

**Priority:** Start with Real Estate and E-commerce (micro-test pages) first, then add the other 3 for validation campaign.
