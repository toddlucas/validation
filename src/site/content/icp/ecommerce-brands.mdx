painPoints:
  - "Buyer or investor asks for documentation—can't prove trademark ownership or find contracts"
  - "Amazon suspended account—can't find platform compliance docs when you need them"
  - "Supplier contract auto-renewed at old (worse) pricing because you missed the deadline"
  - "Trademark renewal missed—lost protection on your brand name, costs $5K+ to fix"
  - "Managing multiple brands? IP documentation scattered across Drive folders—which LLC owns what?"

## All Your Brand Documents. Organized and Exit-Ready.

Your files stay in Google Drive or SharePoint—we add the governance intelligence on top. Whether you have 1 brand or 5, we help you stay organized and ready for growth or exit.

### Track IP, Contracts, and Entity Docs for All Your Brands

- **Trademark assignments** organized and tracked
- **Supplier contracts** with expiration reminders
- **Platform compliance** (Amazon, Shopify) always accessible
- **Entity separation** clear records for each brand's LLC (for multi-brand operators)

### Due Diligence Ready in Days, Not Weeks

- Buyer or investor asks for documentation? Send it instantly
- Prove IP ownership and clean entity records
- Organized documentation = higher valuation
- Save $10K-30K in legal fees during due diligence

### Never Miss Critical Deadlines

- **Trademark renewals** automated reminders
- **Supplier contract expirations** renegotiate before auto-renewal
- **Platform compliance deadlines** avoid account suspensions
- **Annual LLC filings** for each brand entity

## How It Works

1. **Connect your existing storage** (Google Drive, SharePoint, Dropbox)
2. **We organize by brand and entity** with automated deadline tracking
3. **Scale from 1 brand to 5+ without the document chaos**

## Pricing

Starting at **$49/month** for one company, **$99/month** for up to three, and **$199/month** for unlimited.

Compare to:
- Due diligence cleanup before exit: $10,000-30,000
- One missed trademark renewal: $5,000-15,000
- Amazon suspension from missing docs: Lost revenue
- Failed exit because records weren't ready: Priceless

We pay for ourselves with the first crisis you avoid.
