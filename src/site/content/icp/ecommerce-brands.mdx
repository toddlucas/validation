## Built for Multi-Brand E-commerce Operators

Running multiple e-commerce brands means multiple entities, multiple contracts, and multiple headaches. Prise helps you organize everything in one place—so you can focus on growing your brands, not hunting for paperwork.

### How It Works

**1. Organize by Brand**  
Create a workspace for each brand. Store operating agreements, trademark docs, supplier contracts, platform compliance files, and more.

**2. Track What Matters**  
Set reminders for trademark renewals, supplier contract expirations, and platform compliance deadlines. Never miss a critical date again.

**3. Prepare for Exit**  
When it's time to sell a brand (or your whole portfolio), you'll have clean, organized records ready for due diligence. No scrambling, no surprises.

### What You Get

- **Multi-Entity Management**: Separate workspace for each brand/LLC
- **IP Documentation**: Track trademarks, copyrights, and licensing agreements
- **Contract Management**: Store and track supplier, manufacturer, and platform agreements
- **Compliance Tracking**: Platform requirements (Amazon, Shopify) in one place
- **Exit-Ready Records**: Organized documentation for due diligence

### Who Is This For?

Prise is designed for e-commerce operators who:
- Own 2-5 brands (Shopify, Amazon FBA, or hybrid)
- Have separate LLCs for each brand
- Are growing fast and outgrowing Google Drive

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Can I organize documents by brand or by entity?**  
A: Both! You can create custom structures that match how you think about your business.

**Q: What about IP assignments and transfers?**  
A: Yes—we have templates for trademark assignments, IP transfers, and licensing agreements. You can also upload your existing docs.

**Q: Do you integrate with Shopify or Amazon?**  
A: Not yet, but it's on our roadmap. We're focused on document management first, then we'll add platform integrations.

**Q: Can my team access documents?**  
A: Absolutely. Invite team members (VAs, accountants, lawyers) and control their permissions.

**Q: What if I sell one of my brands?**  
A: You can export all documents for that brand, or transfer the workspace to the buyer. Your other brands stay organized and separate.
