## All Your Brands. All Your Entities. Exit-Ready Documentation.

Your files stay in Google Drive or SharePoint—we add the governance intelligence on top.

### Track IP, Contracts, and Entity Docs Across All Brands

- **Trademark assignments** organized by brand and entity
- **Supplier contracts** tracked with expiration reminders
- **Platform compliance** (Amazon, Shopify) always accessible
- **Entity separation** clear records for each brand's LLC

### Due Diligence Ready in Days, Not Weeks

- Aggregator asks for documentation? Send it instantly
- Prove IP ownership across all brands
- Clean entity records = higher valuation
- Save $10K-30K in legal fees during due diligence

### Never Miss Critical Deadlines

- **Trademark renewals** automated reminders
- **Supplier contract expirations** renegotiate before auto-renewal
- **Platform compliance deadlines** avoid account suspensions
- **Annual LLC filings** for each brand entity

## How It Works

1. **Connect your existing storage** (Google Drive, SharePoint, Dropbox)
2. **We organize by brand and entity** with deadline tracking
3. **Build to sell—or build to scale with confidence**

## Pricing

Starting at **$99/month** for up to 3 brands/entities, **$199/month** for unlimited.

Compare to:
- Due diligence cleanup before exit: $10,000-30,000
- One missed trademark renewal: $5,000-15,000
- Amazon suspension from missing docs: Lost revenue
- Failed exit because records weren't ready: Priceless

We pay for ourselves with the first crisis you avoid.
