# ICP Landing Page Updates - February 8, 2026

## Summary of Changes

All five ICP landing pages have been updated to reflect **broadened messaging for initial testing**. This aligns with the updated `tier1-messaging.md` framework that temporarily includes single-entity owners alongside our core multi-entity target.

## What Stayed the Same

✅ **Core value proposition** - Works with existing storage, governance intelligence layer
✅ **Key features** - Deadline tracking, search, organization
✅ **Social proof numbers** - Waitlist counts unchanged
✅ **CTA** - "Join the Waitlist" consistent across all pages
✅ **Hero images** - No changes to image references

---

## Testing Strategy

These broadened pages are designed for:

1. **Micro-Test ($100, 3-5 days)**
   - Real Estate + E-commerce
   - Broader targeting to gather data faster
   
2. **Validation Campaign ($150-200, 7-10 days)**
   - All 5 ICPs
   - Survey on signup will segment single vs. multi-entity

3. **Post-Validation Decision**
   - If multi-entity converts better: narrow messaging back
   - If single-entity converts similarly: keep broad
   - If both convert: create separate variations

---

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Landing pages updated (DONE)
2. ⏳ Add survey questions to signup flow (DEFERRED - not needed for initial test)
3. ⏳ Create ad copy variations (broad vs. narrow)
4. ⏳ Set up Facebook ad campaigns with broader targeting
5. ⏳ Launch micro-test and analyze results

---

## Rollback Plan

If we need to narrow back to multi-entity focus after testing:

1. Revert titles to emphasize "Multi-X" or specific ranges
2. Move multi-entity pain points back to top
3. Remove "from 1 to X" scaling language
4. Remove $49/month entry tier pricing
5. Restore more specific subtitles

All changes are tracked in git, so rollback is straightforward.
